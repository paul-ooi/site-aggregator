At DubBot, great technology is just one part of our solution.

True success comes from supporting our users with exceptional service and a genuine understanding of our clients’ accessibility goals.

Our Client Support Team is at the heart of this approach. With rapid response times, thoughtful resolutions, and expertise in both the DubBot platform and accessibility best practices, they are committed to fostering relationships and empowering our users. Whether it’s answering a quick question or solving a complex issue, they approach every interaction with care, confidence, and a genuine commitment to helping you succeed.

I sat down with several team members to learn how working closely with clients shapes their perspective on the DubBot app, hear their stories from the support frontlines, and, of course, find out what their superhero alter egos would be.  😎

Here’s what they had to say-

## How does working closely with users influence your view of the DubBot app?

**Brian:** I think it shows me how easy-to-use our software is relative to a lot of other applications in the category. Web Accessibility isn't necessarily a simple thing, so making the tools that handle it simply makes tackling it much easier.

**Joanie:** It helps me better understand their real-world wants and needs concerning the app. Working with our users also helps me pinpoint areas of the app that could use some refinement. The positive feedback we receive from our clients also reaffirms for me the reason I came to work at DubBot -- a great product with great people behind it. 

**Alvin:** I love seeing the different ways folks leverage reports and custom policies to extend DubBot for their particular needs.

## To date, what has been the trickiest issue you have helped a client with, and what was the outcome?

**Brian:** Getting our crawler bot to access the insides of a CMS for a crawl - it's more than just crawling a page. It means getting out of the way of the tools within the CMS to then crawl, which is the primary challenge.

**Joanie:** Recently, I customized a policy for a client to prevent it from running on a sub-section of pages within a site. This change kept archival content from being flagged as having a problem that needed review. Removing this content that was considered archival, together with another location that the client could not fix, allowed the more actionable issues to surface for the client.

**Alvin:** I'd have to say some tricky firewall issues where some items were in CDN's or other third-party hosted services and needed to allow our crawler to view them.

## If the support team were a superhero squad, what would your superpower be? And what would your superhero name be?

**Brian:** Enhanced Durability - I'm able to take on a lot without it leaving a mark. I'd probably go against the naming conventions and keep it simple - **_Brian_** would probably work for me.

**Joanie:** Attention to Detail and Consistency. ContistaBella

**Alvin:** Ability to cover a lot of varying issues. Mr. Utility

## Is there anything else you would like to share?

**Brian:** I'm consistently surprised by how technically apt our client base is. As someone who's spent 10+ years doing support, it's a very welcome surprise!

**Joanie:** I enjoy the feeling of camaraderie I get when chatting with our clients - you just don’t get that everywhere.

**Alvin:** Love games of all sort (video, and card / board), and music of varying genres, both playing and listening / building playlists.

It's clear that behind every successful support ticket is a real person – a superhero in disguise! Whether you need help fine-tuning a policy, navigating a tricky crawl, or want to discuss accessibility strategy, our team has your back (and probably a great playlist recommendation too). 

So next time you receive a fast, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable reply, you're likely talking to **ContistaBella**, **Mr. Utility**, or **Brian** (because some heroes don't need a cape).
