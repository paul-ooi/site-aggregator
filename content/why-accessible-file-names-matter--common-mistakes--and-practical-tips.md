Let’s be honest. Most of us don’t give file names much thought. We choose names that make sense to us personally or for the project we’re working on, without considering how clear they are to others.

But file names can make a real impact on accessibility.

Here’s why.

For screen reader users, file names are read aloud, so a name like _“IMG-1234.pdf”_ isn’t helpful. It’s confusing and in no way descriptive.

For users with cognitive complexities, straightforward names reduce mental effort and prevent frustration.

On the legal side, WCAG [SC 2.4.6: Headings and Labels (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") requires clarity in labeling. So accessible file names help keep you compliant.

For everyone, clear and easy-to-understand file names make files easier to find and share.

Here are a few common file naming mishaps to be aware of: 

-   Random strings or default camera names, such as _IMG0098.jpg_.  
      
    
-   Overuse of acronyms or jargon. For example _FY25-QBR-RFP-DRAFT-v3.docx_  
      
    
-   Excessive length, such as _Quarterly-Marketing-Report-For-Internal-Team-Review-And-Approval-By-Senior-Leadership-July-2025-Version3-FINAL-FINAL.pdf_  
      
    
-   No versioning clarity. Your first draft is named _ProjectProposal.docx_  
    If you save multiple drafts, and you don’t use a version scheme in the name, you end up with _ProjectProposal(1).docx, ProjectProposal(2).docx,_ etc. No one knows which one is the final.  
      
    
-   Using special characters, for example, _Marketing_**_&_**_Sales_**_#_**_2025_**_%_**_Report.docx,_ can break links, cause compatibility concerns across different operating systems, and create readability issues for assistive technologies.

The following best practices can help you create more accessible, easy-to-read, and understandable file names:

**Be descriptive but concise.**Example:

-   Inaccessible: _IMG-5678.jpg_
-   Accessible: _Team-Photo-2025.jpg_

**Use plain language.**Example:

-   Inaccessible: _Fiscal-Allocational-Expenditure-Dossier-For-Tertiary-Quarterly.xls_
-   Accessible: _Budget-Report-3rd-Quarter.xls_

**Follow a logical, consistent structure to improve readability.**  
Example:

-   Date-topic-version: _Dec2025-SalesReport-Final.pdf_
-   Or another consistent format, maybe your organization's style guide
-   Consider using camel case: _Dec2025SalesReportFinal.pdf_

**Avoid special characters.**Example:

-   Inaccessible: _Marketing&Sales-Report#2025%Final!.pdf_
-   Accessible: _Marketing-and-Sales-Report-2025-Final.pdf_

**Keep it short.**  
Example:

-   There really isn’t a strict character limit, but a general best practice is to keep file names at or under 32 characters.
-   Some suggest up to 40-50 characters for more complex naming conventions.

**Clear version control.**  
Example:

-   Inaccessible: _ReportFinalFINAL(2).pdf_
-   Accessible: _Accessibility-Audit-Report-2025-v3.pdf_

Accessible file names are a small detail with big benefits. Clear and consistent file naming improves readability and technology compatibility. It also boosts productivity and efficiency, making files easier to find, share, and reuse. Accessible names support inclusive communication, helping people from diverse backgrounds understand file content. Using accessible file names is a simple, powerful way to create more inclusive, effective digital spaces.
