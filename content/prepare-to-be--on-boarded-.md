Welcome to DubBot! We're excited to help you get up and running!

Just because our software is self-service doesn't mean you’re on your own! Our Client Support Team works closely with you to get to know you and your team, understand your goals, how you envision DubBot fitting into your workflow, and what success looks like for your team. From there, we help configure your account so it’s tailored to your needs from day one. It's a goal-driven onboarding experience.

Here's what you can expect.

Your first onboarding session is designed to make you feel confident using the platform, even if you've never worked with web accessibility checking software before. If you have, then much of this should feel familiar to you.  

To help you get the most out of our time together, here's a quick overview of what we'll cover and how you can prepare.  
  

The overall purpose is to get you onboarded (well, yeah 😁). But more specifically, it is to:

-   Get you familiar with the platform's layout and key features.  
      
    
-   Align with your goals and expectations.  
      
    
-   Determine how we'll set up your site(s) and users.  
      
    
-   Make you as self-sufficient as possible without requiring deep technical training.

Now that you're aware of the **why**, let's talk about the game plan - 

1.  Quick recap of where you are in your accessibility journey.  
      
    
2.  Define short and long-term goals.  
      
    
3.  Review your subscription plan and what's included.  
      
    
4.  Determine key setup needs (e.g., SSO, page limits).  
      
    
5.  Review site-specific details and accessibility priorities.  
      
    
6.  Live walkthrough of your dashboard and tools.  
      
    
7.  Q&A and next steps.

During this time, we'll go through a [Site Overview](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/4208681-site-or-page-set-dashboard), highlight the utility of [Page Sets](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/8103232-getting-started-with-page-sets), determine how [filters can help](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/9186056-sorting-accessibility-issues), and build a sample [Custom Report](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/9019539-reports-available-in-dubbot).

In preparation for the meeting, it'll be helpful to prepare yourself with a couple of different things -  

-   What sites are you currently working with? Are there specific areas or domains you'd like to focus on?  
      
    
-   Are you aiming for full compliance or just covering the basics? Do you need help identifying low-hanging fruit vs. long-term fixes?  
      
    
-   Approximately how many pages per site? Are media files (PDFs, videos, etc.) hosted on the same domain or elsewhere?  
      
    
-   Do you have PDFs? Let us know where they're hosted – we’ll help get them scanned properly.  
    

Once the call is complete, we'll move forward with scheduling admin or team training sessions and set a cadence for future check-ins.  

Remember, you don't need to prepare everything in advance; we'll guide you through each step. But if you can share some site details and goals beforehand, we can jump into the hands-on work much faster!

Looking forward to getting started!
