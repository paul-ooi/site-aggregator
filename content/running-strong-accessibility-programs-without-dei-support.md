Wooden blocks teeter on a single point of failure, with a house on top. A hand pulls away one of the support blocks, and the house begins to fall.
Recent executive orders, court rulings, and legislative actions have weakened DEI initiatives, forcing many companies to cut programs and restructure priorities. While accessibility and DEI initiatives are historically separate efforts, they support each other by driving inclusive workplace practices and equitable customer experiences.
With Diversity programs under increasing legal and political scrutiny, accessibility cannot afford to be collateral damage. Organizations must ensure that accessibility remains a core business function, not something dependent on the survival of DEI programs. By embedding accessibility into compliance, product development, customer experience, and leadership accountability, companies can safeguard their commitment to disabled employees and customers—regardless of shifts in DEI policy.
Shift Accessibility to Legal or Compliance Teams
Accessibility is best executed close to design and development. However, it remains a legal requirement even if the federal government orders agencies not to enforce these laws. Furthermore, state laws in California, Colorado, and Massachusetts, as well as international laws, are unaffected by the current federal political upheaval.
Organizations can distance themselves from having their accessibility programs questioned by moving accessibility to under compliance or legal teams. This distances the association between accessibility and “illegal DEI programs.” This approach makes it more difficult to cut budgets since legal and compliance obligations are less likely to be de-emphasized.
Integrate Accessibility into Product Teams
Accessibility should be part of the product and service design and development. Embedding accessibility specialists within engineering teams ensures that accessibility is considered at the start rather than as an optional add-on later. Since this approach distributes accessibility expertise across products, it is also harder to single out a program for deletion.
Tie Accessibility to Customer Experience and Market Reach
Accessibility benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities. Digital accessibility improves usability for all customers, including those using mobile devices, aging populations, and people in low-bandwidth environments. Companies that prioritize accessibility expand their market reach, reduce customer churn, and improve brand loyalty.
Build Accessibility into Procurement Requirements
Many organizations rely on third-party vendors for software, tools, and services. If accessibility is a requirement in procurement contracts, vendors are forced to comply with accessibility standards. This approach ensures that inaccessible products do not create barriers later and reduces remediation costs.
Train Employees to Make Accessibility a Default Practice
Many accessibility failures stem from a lack of knowledge rather than an intent to discriminate or exclude customers or employees with disabilities. Continuing training on accessibility best practices for product managers, designers, developers, and content creators makes compliance more manageable. Make accessibility an expected component of all work.
Create Accessibility Customer and Employee Councils
When DEI programs disappear or are downsized, employee resource groups (ERGs) for disabled employees are often among the first to be cut. One way to replace them is through Accessibility Councils, which include employees and customers with disabilities. These councils can provide direct input on accessibility issues, feature suggestions, and workplace accommodations. They also create an ongoing dialogue between the organization and the people most affected by accessibility decisions. This approach makes these councils a somewhat acceptable alternative to ERGs when budget constraints eliminate traditional DEI structures.
Do Research with Customers with Disabilities
Accessibility requires direct input from the people who use products and services. Companies must invest in research that includes customers with disabilities, ensuring that their experiences guide product design, customer service, and user experience decisions. Reframe accessibility research as part of user experience and compliance efforts to secure funding.
Improve Disabled Customer Support
Many companies prioritize making their products accessible but overlook customer support systems. If disabled customers cannot receive needed assistance, the product's accessibility becomes irrelevant. Businesses must ensure that customer support teams receive accessibility training, offer multiple communication methods (such as relay services and live chat), and design accessible self-service options,
Check in with Sales on Opportunities in Geographies that Require Accessibility
Many countries outside the U.S. have stricter accessibility requirements than the current federal enforcement of domestic laws. The European Accessibility Act, for example, has implications for digital products, software, and physical devices. Sales opportunities in geographies that still require accessibility bolster the argument that organizations shouldn’t be ignoring accessibility. Otherwise, the organization will not be able to capitalize on these opportunities.
Accessibility teams must collaborate closely with sales and legal departments to ensure products comply with global standards, facilitating entry into new markets. Monitoring sales opportunities in these regions is essential to demonstrate the cost/benefit of continuing to run strong accessibility programs.
Improve Disabled Employee Psychological Safety
Even when employers address physical and digital accessibility barriers, many disabled employees still face challenges related to workplace culture and psychological safety. Fear of retaliation, lack of career growth opportunities, and discomfort discussing accommodations can lead to disengagement and high turnover. Organizations must create environments where disabled employees feel safe reporting accessibility barriers, requesting accommodations, and participating fully in the workplace without fear of negative consequences. Anonymous feedback channels, accessibility check-ins with HR, and clear anti-retaliation policies can improve trust and long-term inclusion.
Hold Leadership Accountable
Executives must understand that accessibility is a business necessity, not illegal or a charitable gesture. Regular reporting on accessibility compliance, legal risk, and customer feedback can help keep accessibility a priority. Tying accessibility metrics to performance reviews ensures that leadership takes it seriously.
Stay Connected with the Accessibility Community
Engaging with the broader accessibility community ensures that organizations don’t work in a vacuum. Industry groups, disability advocacy organizations, and professional networks provide valuable support by connecting accessibility professionals who face similar challenges. These communities also offer early insights into evolving standards, regulatory updates, and best practices that can help organizations stay ahead of compliance requirements.
Participating in accessibility conferences, joining working groups, and following key thought leaders can provide critical knowledge that would otherwise take months to filter through official channels. Strong connections within the accessibility space can also help companies navigate legal risks, share solutions, and reinforce their commitment to accessibility even when DEI support is unavailable.
Conclusion
Accessibility programs should not depend on the fate of DEI initiatives. By aligning accessibility with legal, product, customer experience, procurement, and leadership goals, organizations can ensure that accessibility remains a permanent and protected function. Accessibility is not an extra. It is a fundamental part of executing responsible business activities.
