With current shifts in public sentiment and external pressures regarding DEI, some organizations have paused, rebranded, or scaled back their initiatives.

The simple truth is, if you market, sell, inform, educate, connect, or build community online, digital accessibility still matters.

While companies scramble to keep up with AI, rethink content strategies, or tiptoe around conversations about equality, accessibility is quietly doing what it always does: making the web work better for more people.

That’s why digital accessibility remains not only relevant but critical to your organization’s success.

**Let’s start with increased market reach.** More than 1.3 billion people live with a disability worldwide. That’s roughly 1 in 5 of us, depending on the data set. When your website and digital assets are accessible, you help serve this large, underserved market. People with disabilities, their families, and caregivers have significant purchasing power—a group with over $13 trillion in disposable income.

**Could your search engine optimization (SEO) use a boost?** Having an accessible website will do that for you. Your website structure is vital in influencing your SEO and is critical in creating an accessible website. Descriptive page titles, proper heading structures, descriptive ALT text, and plain language are just a few ways search engines can better understand the content of your website. [Proper page structure](https://dubbot.com/dubblog/2024/page-structure.html) enhances indexing and improves visibility in search results.

**Your customers are watching you.** When your website is accessible, you strengthen your brand by showing you care about people—not just profits. Now more than ever, [socially conscious consumers](https://builtin.com/articles/conscious-consumerism "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") pay attention to how organizations conduct their business and represent themselves. Accessibility is a key part of that picture. Customers vote with their wallets.

**Steer clear of legal trouble.** Having an accessible website—one built to [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), tested with real users, and regularly maintained—is a smart risk management strategy. Inaccessible sites can lead to costly ADA lawsuits.

> _In the first quarter of 2025, 983 ADA website accessibility lawsuits were filed across the United States—marking a 25.3% increase from 785 lawsuits filed in Q1 2024. ~_ [_EcomBack ADA Website Lawsuits Report From January to March 2025_](https://www.ecomback.com/ada-website-lawsuits-recap-report/q1-2025-ada-website-accessibility-lawsuit-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com "This link leaves the DubBlog website.")

In other words, investing in accessibility isn’t just the right thing to do—it’s the savvy move to safeguard your business from costly legal trouble down the road.

**Where Do You Go from Here?** If you’ve been wondering whether digital accessibility is still relevant, the answer is a resounding yes. Even in an uncertain cultural moment, accessibility is still one of the smartest investments you can make. If your organization is rethinking its DEI efforts, don’t let accessibility fall off the radar. It’s not a political statement—it’s a human one.
