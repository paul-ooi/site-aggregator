Some of our best product updates didn’t come from a boardroom brainstorm—they came straight from our clients' "wouldn’t it be nice if…" moments.

That’s precisely what inspired our latest product update. ✨

You can now opt to view individual category scores on your Account Dashboard! Check it out!

From your Site Dashboard, select _Dashboard_ from the choices at the top right. This will take you to your Account Dashboard.

From your Account Dashboard, select the _View Columns_ icon.

![Account Dashboard, select the View Columns icon in the upper right](../../images/blog-content/2025/click-view-columns-icon.png)

Then select which category score you would like to add. Every category tested for your account is available: Accessibility Issues Score, Best Practices Score, Broken Links Score, Misspellings Score, SEO Score, and Web Governance Score.

In this example, I have chosen to add the Accessibility Issues Score and the Broken Links Score. The score column appears to the right of the selected category.

No one knows what needs fixing or improving better than our clients, the people who use DubBot every single day. Our clients aren't just users—they’re co-creators.

Client feedback is a crucial part of how we continually improve DubBot. We use it to cut through assumptions, challenge our roadmap, and build features that our clients need, want, and ask for.

A human author creates the DubBlog posts. The AI tool Gemini is sometimes used to brainstorm subject ideas, generate blog post outlines, and rephrase certain portions of the content. Our marketing team carefully reviews all final drafts for accuracy and authenticity. The opinions and perspectives expressed remain the sole responsibility of the human author.
