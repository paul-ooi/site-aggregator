It’s that time of year again. Planning an inclusive holiday party goes beyond picking out festive decorations or sending fancy invitations. It’s about creating an environment where every employee feels welcome, safe, and able to fully participate. For employees with disabilities, holiday events can present unique barriers, from inaccessible invitations to overwhelming sensory elements and pressure to attend. By taking a few small yet meaningful steps, corporate event organizations can make their holiday gatherings truly inclusive, allowing everyone to join in the festivities on their terms. Here are key ways to ensure your event is accessible and enjoyable for all.

**Make sure the invitation is accessible**

Almost every time, invitations for these types of events arrive in email. Many times they consist of a subject line that says “Holiday party” and a single line of text that says “See attached invitation.” Almost every time, fancy .PDF files and electronic card delivery service invitations are not accessible. This means that people who use screen readers don’t get the information included in images. People with dyslexia might struggle to read overly ornate decorative fonts. This can make people feel excluded before the event even starts. A vastly better approach is to:

1) Send invitations in an accessible HTML email or include a text-only version with clear, simple instructions and key details.

2) Include a calendar invite with the fancy invitation that contains all the important details such as time, date, location, dress code, and RSVP information.

Making this small adjustment shows thoughtfulness and ensures that everyone feels welcome and informed from the start.

**Make sure the event is TRULY optional, not “optional-ish”**

The holidays are exhausting for everyone, but they are especially exhausting for people with disabilities. For some, attending extra social events can mean dealing with physical fatigue, overstimulation, navigating inaccessible spaces, or being faced with food they are really not supposed to be eating. This holiday party hangover (which may not have even included alcohol) can lead to them spending less time with their families during a season meant to be family-focused. Also, many disabled people plan medical treatment that involves taking time off around the holidays so their absence is less felt and the expense happens before their health insurance deductible resets on January 1.

When an “optional” event feels mandatory, people may feel pressured to attend even when it's challenging or uncomfortable. What makes an optional event not optional? When attendance is linked to recognition, networking, or future career opportunities. These optional-ish events create pressure to attend. True optionality means there are no hidden expectations or career implications tied to attendance, allowing people to make the best choice for their health and well-being.

Give people the freedom to opt out without guilt by clearly stating that participation is completely voluntary. Reinforce this by providing alternative ways to connect, like a digital message board or small group gatherings. Respecting boundaries goes a long way to make the holiday season more inclusive and less stressful for everyone.

**Have a quiet zone at the venue**

The holiday season is packed with social gatherings. These events can be draining even for those who enjoy them. Keep in mind, this may not be the first holiday event your attendee has been to that week, or even that day. By offering a location to decompress, companies make it easier for employees and their +1s to join in the festivities without feeling overstimulated or pressured to keep up with the high energy of a party.

A quiet zone also benefits those who may not have visible disabilities, or those who don’t consider themselves disabled but feel overwhelmed by noise and crowds. By considering the needs of all employees, companies show that they respect individual differences and are committed to fostering a welcoming atmosphere. The simple addition of a quiet space can transform the event into a truly enjoyable experience for everyone.

**Avoid flashing lights, shiny objects and twinkling lights**

You know how to make a party a real downer? Set up an environment that triggers an epileptic seizure, calling an ambulance, and then having to provide evidence for a workman’s compensation claim. Flashing lights, rapid visual effects, and intense visual patterns might seem festive to many folx, but they can pose a serious risk for guests with epilepsy or migraine disorders. In these moments, what was supposed to be a fun event can become life threatening.

Safety should always come first. Put the holiday tree lights on “steady” mode rather than blinking and ditch the disco ball. Lower the light intensity and if you have a looping presentation of photos from the years activities, opt for smooth and not jarring or sudden transitions. These tiny modifications will make the atmosphere inclusive and enjoyable for everyone.

**Make sure the venue AS YOU ARE GOING TO USE IT is accessible**

One of my worst experiences at a party hosted by a previous employer was at an event that claimed it was accessible but wasn’t. I left five minutes after I arrived, in part because it was so crowded with employees, their +1s, the buffet line and overstuffed furniture that there was no way for me to get around in my wheelchair without continually asking people to move, which I had to do at top volume since it was so loud no one could hear the request in a regular volume voice.

It’s not enough to ask the venue if they are accessible. Most sites say yes without really thinking about what that means. Think about circulation paths, where people will line up for food, accessible bathroom locations, and whether people with mobility disabilities will be able to negotiate their way easily around all of that.

For bonus points, as the venue if their servers are trained on how to assist people with disabilities and treat people with service animals. These things count in making people with disabilities feel like they belong, and the servers will take this knowledge where ever they go.

**Look at every activity through a disability inclusion lens**

Are you having a raffle? Think about how people who can’t write will enter, and how people who can’t hear will know if they have won. White elephant gift exchange? Make sure that each participant knows to describe their package if someone who is blind is participating, and use numbers rather than calling out people’s names. Ornament assembly? Have someone willing to assist disabled participants if they are by themselves. If the event involves “stations” such as a photo booth, canned foot drop off, or cookie decorating, make sure an accessible map is provided to any blind participants so they can navigate the event on their own.

**Conclusion**

Making your holiday party accessible is a powerful way to show employees that your commitment to inclusion is genuine. Accessible invitations, clear communication, optional participation, quiet zones, safe lighting, and accessible spaces reflect a a desire for all attendees to feel like they belong and were thought of during the event planning process.

It’s never “just a party.” Acts of exclusion can alienate, while acts of inclusion can carry over into every aspect of workplace culture. An inclusive holiday party isn’t just a seasonal gesture; it’s an opportunity to build a more supportive, understanding environment that celebrates the diversity within your organization all year long.
