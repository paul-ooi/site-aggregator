[New England Drupal Camp](https://nedcamp.org/) (also known as NEDcamp) celebrates its twenty-first birthday this November 14-15. DubBot is [proud to be a sponsor](https://nedcamp.org/sponsors), and I'm thrilled to be an attendee. NEDcamp is held at [Rhode Island College](https://www.ric.edu/) in Providence, Rhode Island and is an all-volunteer effort to support and grow the Drupal community in New England.

This year's NEDcamp boasts a [wide range of sessions](https://nedcamp.org/session-agenda) on topics ranging from front-end development to AI and beyond. Keynote speaker [Jason Pamental](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpamental) will explore [curiosity and its role in design](https://nedcamp.org/sessions/2025/keynote-curious-findings).

One great thing about NEDcamp is its encouragement of first-time presenters and new Drupalists. First-time speaker [Mark Felton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markfelton/), Director of Technical & Strategic Solutions at Tag1, said:

> "I attended my first NEDCamp at Rhode Island College last year. What struck me was the low price of entry and the quality of the sessions. Anyone, even students, can afford to attend. I’m a mid-lifer who has managed a rewarding career with Drupal, but we absolutely need to bring a new generation into this amazing community." ~ Mark Felton

I'm also excited to be attending the [NEDSummit on Higher Education](https://nedcamp.org/summit-agenda) the day before the main conference. This summit brings together Drupalists from colleges and universities to discuss the challenges faced in their work with Drupal and higher ed. Summit sessions will explore the role of the university website as a part of today's broader digital ecosystem.

In a future blog post, I'll be sharing highlights from NEDcamp 2025, so stay tuned for a recap of the whole event!
