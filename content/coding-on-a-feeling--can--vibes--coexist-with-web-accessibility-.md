Several weeks ago, as I do most mornings, I was scrolling through my copy of the _CNN 5 Things_ newsletter. In the section called Breakfast Browse, there was a link titled ['Vibe coding' named Collins Dictionary’s Word of the Year](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/tech/vibe-coding-collins-word-year-scli-intl?bt_ee=x%2BxrPrKAXATjnkijZ1mATK92k7K7tciqRMfSl1JG9s8euHP0LVkig8S7PsPFzekg&bt_ts=1763074613368 "This link leaves the DubBlog website."). I was intrigued. I’ve been reading about vibe coding and trying to decide whether to write a post about it. Clearly, I’ve made my decision.

## So, What Exactly is Vibe Coding?

> The term, coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy in early 2025, describes a workflow where the primary role shifts from writing code line-by-line to guiding an AI assistant to generate, refine, and debug an application through a more conversational process. This frees you up to think about the big picture, or the main goal of your app, while the AI handles writing the actual code. [Vibe Coding Explained: Tools and Guides](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-vibe-coding "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") 

To be more specific, instead of starting from specs or traditional frameworks, developers build interfaces and interactions based on aesthetic instincts and intuitive user flows by using natural language prompts. AI then writes the code. Vibe coding is writing code based on intuition and aesthetics rather than a strict adherence to documentation or standards.

Not a formal methodology, though that will probably change soon; it’s becoming a recognized development style. Vibe coding is primarily used by [indie coders and developers](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-definition "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), as well as in [rapid prototyping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/what-is-rapid-prototyping/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") environments.

It’s creative, flexible, and fast. But when it comes to digital accessibility, that doesn’t always equal inclusion.

## What does Vibe Coding Mean for Accessibility?

The truth is, it's complicated. On one hand, using natural language prompts lowers the technical barrier to entry, allowing more people to create websites, apps, and other digital tools. Vibe coding can also automate tedious tasks, freeing up experienced developers to focus on higher-level programming and problem-solving.

On the other hand, a coding process that prioritizes aesthetics and rapid development over quality, with AI-generated code that may not be adequately vetted by human oversight and testing, has the potential to introduce accessibility issues and biases that traditional development processes would catch.

Let's look at the pros and cons of vibe coding as it relates to accessibility, and determine whether it can actually create inclusive experiences.

### Pros of Vibe Coding for Accessibility

**Rapid Prototyping of Accessible Ideas**

Vibe coding is fast, which can be beneficial during early concept phases. Developers can quickly test accessible features like high-contrast themes, sound cues, and haptic feedback without committing to a full-scale build.

**Empathy-Driven Design**

When developers focus on how it feels to use a website or app, they can create more human-centered experiences, especially when paired with user personas or, better yet, actual user feedback.

**Creative Freedom Leads to Innovation**

Strict adherence to standards can sometimes stifle experimentation. Vibe coding developers to experiment with new, outside-the-box accessibility ideas as long as those experiments get properly tested.

### Cons of Vibe Coding for Accessibility

**Standards May Be Ignored**

Vibe coding excels in the gray areas of creativity and experimentation, but accessibility doesn’t work that way. If developers rely on intuition rather than established standards like WCAG, Section 508, ARIA, or semantic HTML, important accessibility considerations can be missed altogether.

**Inconsistent User Experiences**

Just because something feels intuitive to a developer doesn’t mean it works well for everyone. Features that look cool on screen might completely block a screen reader user or someone navigating the website or app with only a keyboard.

**Harder to Maintain or Audit**

Vibe-coded interfaces often lack documentation, consistency, and naming conventions. This makes accessibility audits more difficult and increases the likelihood of regressions over time, slowing the development process, increasing maintenance costs and person-power, and reducing confidence in the code.

**Unconscious Biases Get Baked In**

Without regular, intentional checks, what feels right to a developer often reflects their own experience. That means designs look or work fine for you, but are completely unusable for screen reader users or people who are low-vision or navigate with only a keyboard. In other words, vibe coding can unintentionally bake in ableist defaults when accessibility isn’t part of the process.

## Can Vibe Coding Be Accessible?

Yes, vibe coding can be accessible, but it’s not inherently so. The key is balancing intuition with proven accessibility practices such as the WCAG guidelines, semantic HTML, and ARIA roles. 

In addition, all code should be tested with both automotive tools and manually. Developers must intentionally and regularly check their assumptions and aesthetics. Without that, _what feels right_ risks leaving out anyone who experiences the web differently.
