Accessibility remediation work can be very detailed; a single issue can span hundreds of web pages. Effective task management is crucial for successful remediation projects and efficient workflows.

Breaking a large project into small, manageable tasks enables project managers to create more accurate schedules and set realistic deadlines. This, in turn, helps resource allocation—whether it's people, budget, or tools—by providing a clear understanding of what's needed for each task. Furthermore, potential obstacles and interdependencies also become easier to spot. 

Effective task management requires a platform where team members can easily track progress, identify dependencies, and communicate clearly, promoting collaboration and team cohesion.

With [DubBot's Task Management](https://dubbot.com/features/task-management.html "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") function, all tasks created in your account are centralized in the Tasks Panel. Users can track and address accessibility issues across their entire website, regardless of complexity or scope. They can filter and sort all assigned tasks by "status," "site," "assigned to," "created by," and "issue type" to receive updates on the progress of specific tasks and issues, as well as identify whom to go to for questions or to collaborate on a solution.

What brings it all together is that users with GitHub accounts can push and close their DubBot task details to their GitHub repositories. Users with admin permissions can [add a GitHub Connector to user accounts](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/8250561-add-the-github-connector-to-your-dubbot-account "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") to connect DubBot Tasks to GitHub. This connector streamlines workflows by seamlessly transferring issue data from DubBot to production, significantly increasing efficiency. Users can also push and close tasks with GitLab and Jira.

Good task management is intrinsically linked to successful project management, smoother workflows, reduced confusion, and a greater sense of shared success.
