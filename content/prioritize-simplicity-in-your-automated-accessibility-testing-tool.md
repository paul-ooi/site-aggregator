The whole point of accessibility is to make things easier for everyone. So why are you okay with accessibility tools that are so complex only a handful of your team are willing to use them? Why settle for an accessibility tool that’s overly complex, hard to navigate, and frustratingly expensive? The right tool should support your efforts, not stand in your way. If your vendor truly believes in accessibility, shouldn't their tool be, you know… accessible?

At DubBot, we’re all about keeping it simple. Because simple works. It’s easier to use, easier to understand, and [it's accessible](when-your-accessibility-tool-isnt-accessible.html). That’s exactly what our automated accessibility testing tool delivers.

When your automated testing platform is simple and intuitive, users catch on fast and start getting things done. It’s a smart way to build momentum around accessibility and get people genuinely engaged.

A simpler automated accessibility testing platform reduces distractions. Instead of wrestling with a complicated tool, you stay grounded in the actual accessibility work and focused on the accessibility goals. 

A simpler platform helps reduce stress by minimizing both the workload and mental clutter, allowing you to focus on creating more sustainable, site-wide accessibility solutions. 

A simpler platform reduces the hours required for training and support, helping you stay on schedule and manage your workload efficiently, which ultimately lowers your overall cost of ownership.

Finally, a simpler platform often means [a more accessible platform](when-your-accessibility-tool-isnt-accessible.html). If your platform isn’t accessible, you’re essentially putting roadblocks in front of your own team, creating barriers that slow them down, frustrate their workflow, and limit their productivity, which ultimately costs your company time, money, and opportunities.

Simplicity isn’t about dumbing things down. It’s about clearing the path so _everyone_ can participate, understand, and interact with ease.
