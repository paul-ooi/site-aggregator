Chain of paper cut out figures with one missing in the middle
Over the past few years, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs have become more visible in workplaces across the globe. These initiatives were designed to create more inclusive environments for people of all backgrounds, including employees with disabilities. Unfortunately, many organizations are scaling back or eliminating their DEI programs. Companies such as Facebook, McDonald’s, Tractor Supply, and Harley Davidson have dismantled existing DEI initiatives, signaling a concerning, likely politically-driven trend. While these actions may feel disheartening, people with disabilities can take proactive steps to safeguard their workplace rights, ensure their needs are met, and find support.
Here are some strategies to consider during this transition:
1. Request Written Feedback and Confirm Verbal Feedback via Email
Feedback plays a vital role in career development, but it can be challenging for employees with disabilities to get feedback that is clear, actionable, and accessible. As DEI programs disappear, the channels that might have supported constructive and equitable feedback could diminish. To address this, make it a practice to document feedback in writing.
Sometimes, you can't get managers to provide feedback in writing.  If you receive verbal feedback in a meeting or one-on-one conversation, follow up with an email summarizing the discussion. For example, you might write:
"Hi [Manager’s Name],
Thanks for meeting with me today to discuss [topic]. I want to ensure I captured everything correctly. Here’s a summary of what I understood from our conversation: [details of feedback]. Please let me know if I missed anything or misunderstood."

Even if the manager said everything is fine, document that as well.   This approach has several benefits. It clarifies expectations, reduces the risk of miscommunication, and provides a written record of the discussion. If a pattern of bias or inequity emerges, having documentation can be useful for escalating concerns or involving HR if necessary.
If verbal feedback leaves you with more questions than answers, consider asking your manager for written feedback. You might frame this request to help you meet expectations and grow in your role. Also, keep paper or electronic copies of your reviews off work computer systems.
2. Formalize Informal Accommodations
Many employees with disabilities rely on informal accommodations.  An informal accommodation is any change a manager makes at your request without going through the formal HR accommodations process. These might include a flexible schedule, occasional work-from-home days, or verbal agreements about workload adjustments. While informal arrangements can work well when there is mutual trust and understanding, they are more vulnerable to change if a supportive manager leaves or company policies shift.
Now is the time to formalize these arrangements. Contact your HR department to begin the formal accommodation process, even if it feels unnecessary or awkward. Formalizing accommodations ensures that they are documented and protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or other relevant laws. This can also provide greater stability and consistency, regardless of who your manager is.
When initiating the process, focus on specific needs rather than medical diagnoses. For example, instead of saying, “I need this because of my condition,” frame your request around the task or environment:
“I need a flexible start time because it helps me manage my energy levels and be more productive throughout the day.”

HR teams can request medical documentation from your healthcare provider, but ONLY for invisible disabilities they are unaware of.  If your disability is visible or you have a previous accommodation on record, they may not request additional documentation.  Ask your doctor or therapist to prepare a letter outlining your accommodation needs. Keep a copy of all correspondence for your records.
3. Build Support Networks Outside of Work
One of the strengths of robust DEI programs is the sense of community they nurture among underrepresented groups, including people with disabilities. Finding support networks outside the workplace becomes even more critical as these programs disappear. These networks can provide encouragement, advice, and a sense of belonging when the workplace is uncertain. An external support system can also provide a sounding board for workplace issues, such as approaching difficult conversations or advocating for yourself without support from a formal DEI program.
4. Join local or online disability advocacy groups
Many organizations focus on supporting people with specific disabilities or addressing workplace inclusion. Examples include the Job Accommodation Network (JAN), Disability:IN, and the National Federation of the Blind.
5. Seek mentorship opportunities
Mentorship from someone who understands the challenges of navigating the workplace with a disability can be invaluable. If your company no longer offers formal mentorship programs, look for industry groups or LinkedIn connections who might be willing to share advice.
6. Participate in community events
Local meetups, webinars, or virtual events centered on disability inclusion can be great places to build connections. Don’t underestimate the power of community to help you feel less isolated and more empowered.
Additional Considerations
While asking for written feedback, formalizing accommodations, and building external networks are key steps, it’s worth considering a few additional strategies:
Stay up-to-date on your rights: Familiarize yourself with local and national disability rights laws, such as the ADA in the United States. Understanding your legal protections can help you advocate for yourself more effectively.
Learn how to self-advocate: With fewer DEI resources, self-advocacy becomes even more critical. Practice communicating your needs and boundaries.
Monitor your workplace’s commitments. Even if formal DEI programs are gone, companies must not allow discrimination. Monitor whether your employer upholds its stated values and document any gaps or inconsistencies.
Keep receipts: If a discriminatory act or comment occurs, write it down immediately, recording the time, place, speaker, and what was said. If you are in a meeting, briefly turn off your video and take a picture of the screen to prove the meeting occurred. Keep these records on a personal device with no work access.
Check-in with co-workers or friends who are in the same situation. Some people need to vent to someone in the same situation. Hearing others' experiences can help you validate your own and provide mutual support during challenging times.
Conclusion
The rollback of DEI programs is a setback for workplace inclusion, but it doesn’t mean employees with disabilities are without options. Some companies, such as Costco, are fighting against activist shareholder requests to eliminate DEI.  Without a formal DEI program, the responsibility for enforcing non-discriminatory workplaces may fall, unfortunately, to the person being discriminated against.  By taking proactive steps to document feedback, formalize accommodations, and build external support networks, you can create greater stability and resilience in your career. These actions protect your rights and empower you to thrive in a workplace that may be less supportive than it once was.
While it’s disappointing to see companies step away from DEI initiatives, remember that the disability community is strong, resourceful, and ready to support one another. Together, we can continue advocating for inclusion and equity, even when organizational priorities shift.
