DubBot is proud to once again be a [Platinum Sponsor](https://events.digicol.org/digicol25/sponsors "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") of the [Digital Collegium 2025 Annual Conference](https://events.digicol.org/digicol25/4953434 "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), where higher ed professionals come together to share insights, sharpen skills, and build the connections that drive your industry forward.  

Join us in Grand Rapids, Michigan, from September 28 to October 1, for four days packed with inspiring sessions, seven unique tracks, and opportunities to connect at social events.

And you won’t want to miss DubBot’s [Penny Kronz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/penny-kronz-7046969/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") as she breaks down the [ABCs and 123s of website accessibility](https://events.digicol.org/digicol25/session/3169890/abcs-and-123s-of-website-accessibility "This link leaves the DubBlog website.")—a session that makes web accessibility terms easy to understand and approachable for everyone.

Can’t make it in person? No worries—you can join online and still get all the expert insights and fresh perspectives to take back to your campus.

New this year! Make it a shared experience by streaming live sessions in a shared space. Up to 25 colleagues can join you for real-time learning, collaboration, and great discussions.

[Early bird registration](https://events.digicol.org/digicol25/registration "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") closes July 31, so [hurry and register now](https://events.digicol.org/digicol25/registration "This link leaves the DubBlog website.").

See you in September!

A human author creates the DubBlog posts. The AI tool Gemini is sometimes used to brainstorm subject ideas, generate blog post outlines, and rephrase certain portions of the content. Our marketing team carefully reviews all final drafts for accuracy and authenticity. The opinions and perspectives expressed remain the sole responsibility of the human author.
