New England Drupal Camp (NEDCamp) was a great success this year, as it is every year. DubBot is proud to be a NEDCamp sponsor.

The [NEDSummit on Higher Education](https://nedcamp.org/summit-agenda "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") brought together marketing and technology professionals from a wide range of colleges and universities in and near New England. It's clear that the higher education sector faces many challenges today, and the summit presented several examples of how some schools are facing them, with ample time for attendees to discuss each presentation and share their own experiences.

Summit keynote speaker [Jessica Pontarelli Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicapontarelli "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), from Brown University, emphasized the civic roles of the university and how its website and social media can build trust in that institution. She said:  

> ...I don't think that's a marketing challenge or just a marketing challenge. I think it's a civic challenge because universities are more than sort of academic factories...I think at their best, universities and colleges, they're civic actors.
> 
> That's how we talk about it where I am. They're places that bring people together to learn, to create, to contribute, and to question. And I think the digital spaces that we maintain, that we build, that we secure, they're part of the civic infrastructure of the university. And every decision that we make, big and small, all of it signals who we are and what we value. And I think it's not about just writing code or copy. I think we're helping shape identity, belonging, and trust at our universities.

The main NEDCamp conference was a day of learning across a broad spectrum of topics. "We come to camp to get out of our bubbles," as one speaker put it. "Curiosity is a practice," said keynote speaker [Jason Pamental](https://youtu.be/Bb-VnwmrwNw?si=r1qQchLGiELAMNxB "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), as he shared stories of creative individuals who pursue knowledge and keep asking questions as they progress in their work and in their lives. As long as we remain curious, we can continue to grow, thrive, and innovate.

This theme of creativity and flexibility was also prominent in Erin White's presentation on [building a culture of accessibility](https://youtu.be/-3i_-kneoXA "This link leaves the DubBlog website."). They made the point that it's possible to build a 100% standards-compliant site that is not actually accessible in real-life, practical terms. They advocate moving beyond merely viewing accessibility as a final item on a project's checklist. They said organizations should involve as many people as possible in learning, practicing, and supporting accessibility efforts so that it transforms from a moment of rote compliance to an organizational value of "this is just how we do things here."

The use and impact of AI were of major concern and were addressed in multiple sessions. Search engines that incorporate AI no longer deliver the clicks that were the objective of traditional SEO (search engine optimization). [J. Hogue and Julie Elman](https://youtu.be/ga5iTrh8GyU?si=PbvQPAHCFOHU74h9 "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") gave a wide-ranging presentation on how digital strategy needs to change if you want your content to be discoverable in this new search environment.

NEDCamp continues to be a great opportunity for Drupalists in the region to meet, contribute, learn, and have fun together. See you there in 2026!
