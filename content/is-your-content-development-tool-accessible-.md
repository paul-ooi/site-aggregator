There was an interesting conversation on the DubBot support line the other day. A potential client had asked one of our account executives to "compare and contrast" the accessibility checking features of DubBot with their organization’s content management system (CMS). 

That conversation got me thinking about a set of W3C guidelines that you may not have heard a lot about. Those guidelines are the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."). These guidelines not only outline criteria for authoring tools to be accessible but also require that the tool itself work in a way that creates accessible content.

The W3C's Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) provide a comprehensive framework to ensure that digital content creation tools support accessibility at every level. The overview page of ATAG breaks that framework down into two parts:  

1.  Make the authoring tool user interface accessible
2.  Support the production of accessible content 

## Make the authoring tool user interface accessible

A foundational principle of ATAG is that the authoring tool’s user interface must comply with [established accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") for both web-based and non-web-based functionality, ensuring that every part of the tool can be used effectively by people with a range of abilities.

The editing views within the tool, where users create and modify content, must be designed to be perceivable, operable, and understandable. Authors should be able to perceive all elements of the editing interface, including access to alternative content and the ability for assistive technologies to determine how content is presented. Those views must be fully operable using a keyboard, provide sufficient time for interaction, and avoid any flashing content that might trigger seizures. Structured navigation, text search, and customizable settings further support usability.

In addition, previews generated within the authoring tool should be as accessible as the browsers or user agents that will ultimately display the content. 

ATAG also emphasizes the importance of helping authors avoid and correct mistakes, reinforcing the need for clear and helpful feedback during the content creation process. 

Lastly, all aspects of the user interface, including accessibility features, should be thoroughly documented to ensure that authors understand how to use the tool effectively. 

## Support the production of accessible content.

ATAG emphasizes the importance of automated processes in producing accessible content. When using [automatically generated content](https://www.urlslab.com/glossary/auto-generated-content/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), the authoring tool must ensure that it is accessible by default.

Next, the guidelines highlight the importance of empowering authors to create accessible content by providing clear guidance throughout the process. For example, authoring tools should assist users with managing alternative text for non-text content, selecting and using accessible templates, and integrating pre-authored content that meets accessibility standards.

ATAG also calls for tools to help improve the accessibility of existing content by providing authors with features to identify accessibility issues and offering support or automation in fixing those problems.

Finally, the guidelines underscore the importance of promoting and integrating accessibility features within the tools themselves. Features that support accessible content creation must be readily available, and documentation should clearly explain how to use these features to create inclusive content.

Please note that ATAG is primarily intended for developers of authoring tools. But having an understanding of ATAG and what compliance looks like will help you in [choosing your next authoring tool](https://w3c.github.io/wai-selecting-authoring-tools/design-develop/authoring-tools/selecting/#venqu "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), such as a (WYSIWYG) HTML editor, a learning management system (LMS), or a content management system.

A human author creates the DubBlog posts. The AI tool Gemini is sometimes used to brainstorm subject ideas, generate blog post outlines, and rephrase certain portions of the content. Our marketing team carefully reviews all final drafts for accuracy and authenticity. The opinions and perspectives expressed remain the sole responsibility of the human author.
