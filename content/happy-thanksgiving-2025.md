Today, we’re grateful for all the folks who show up every day, pushing accessibility forward one fix, feature, and fearless audit at a time. Your work makes the web kinder and easier for everyone. 

Thank you for making us part of your journey. Here’s to rest, gratitude, and the good things still ahead.
