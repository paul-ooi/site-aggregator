A well-crafted website **accessibility statement** is one of the most effective ways to demonstrate to visitors that your organization has made a genuine commitment to accessibility and inclusivity.

Back in 2021, I wrote [a blog post on accessibility statements](https://dubbot.com/dubblog/2021/make-a-statement.html) that made the same point. I thought it was time to update that post to add more specific content related to the impact an accessibility statement can have on your brand. Let’s take a look at why accessibility statements really matter to your brand.

Accessibility statements matter because they serve multiple crucial purposes. They reinforce the organization's commitment to building and maintaining an accessible user experience. They support legal compliance, helping organizations meet obligations under civil rights laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Accessibility statements then go beyond legal requirements to help build trust, foster transparency about accessibility efforts and challenges, which is especially important for users with disabilities. Additionally, they encourage continuous improvement by providing a clear way for users to report issues and offer feedback.

## Brand Impact

The presence or absence of an accessibility statement can greatly influence your organization’s brand. Organizations that prioritize accessibility position themselves as forward-thinking, customer-centered, and socially responsible. On the other hand, staying silent can make your brand appear careless or out of touch, especially as more users expect inclusivity to be the norm.

The lack of an accessibility statement typically signals an inaccessible website, causing:

### Reputational damage

-   A missing statement can lead customers to believe that your brand does not prioritize or understand web accessibility, which is expected from the majority of today's business community.  
      
    
-   When users with disabilities encounter accessibility barriers on your site, they may feel excluded and develop a negative perception of your brand.

> Nielsen’s data / surveys show people with disabilities are likely to disengage: 61% say they would stop purchasing from brands that don’t respect their community; 63% would consider seeking a new brand if their current brand doesn’t align with causes they care about. ~ [Beyond Disability: Inclusive Marketing in an Intersectional World](https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2024/beyond-disability-inclusive-marketing-intersectional-world/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.")

-   It can create negative word-of-mouth with public backlash on social media and other platforms, potentially reaching a much wider audience.  
      
    
-   Businesses that prioritize corporate social responsibility may be less likely to partner with companies that do not demonstrate a clear commitment to digital inclusion.

### Legal and Financial Risks

-   A missing statement, especially on a website with access barriers, can be used by plaintiff law firms as evidence that your company's broader accessibility efforts are insufficient.  
      
    
-   An organization that appears inattentive to accessibility may become a frequent target for demand letters and lawsuits.  
      
    
-   Websites with accessibility barriers alienate and exclude potential customers with disabilities.  With [one in four U.S. adults having a disability](https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disabilities-health-care-access.html "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), this can result in significant missed business opportunities and lost revenue.

## We Have an Accessibility Policy. Why Do We Need a Statement?

Your accessibility policy and your accessibility statement serve two separate purposes. Your accessibility policy is the organization's internal playbook, the rule book for meeting accessibility standards. Your accessibility statement is the public-facing promise, **your handshake with the public**, that shows users your organization's commitment to compliance and accountability.

## What Makes Up a Well-crafted Accessibility Statement?

-   **Commitment:** An explicit declaration of the organization's dedication to digital accessibility.  
      
    
-   **Scope:** Describe what Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) your statement covers. For example, your website, specific applications, and digital content, such as documents and presentations.  
      
    
-   **Goals and Standards:** Acknowledgment of relevant laws and regulations, such as the ADA and Section 508, along with the specific accessibility standards the organization aims to meet, such as WCAG 2.2 AA.  
      
    
-   **Monitoring Methods:** Explain, in [plain language](https://dubbot.com/dubblog/2025/keep-it-simple-plain-language-readability-and-inclusion.html) and briefly, how your organization [monitors accessibility](https://dubbot.com/dubblog/2025/a-guide-to-continuous-accessibility-monitoring.html), i.e., automated testing, audits, and user feedback. Frame your accessibility activities as a continuous effort rather than a one-time achievement.  
      
    
-   **Contact Information:** Provide a clear and accessible mechanism for users to report accessibility issues, provide feedback, or request assistance. Always provide an email address and a phone number, at a minimum.  
      
    
-   **Statement Date:** Provide the date the statement was prepared and the last review date, ensuring transparency about the statement's currency.

## Best Practices for a Better Well-crafted Accessibility Statement

While crafting your accessibility statement, keep in mind these best practices:

-   Only claim conformance to accessibility standards if it’s accurate. Users can check these claims for themselves.  
      
    
-   Use simple, plain language and avoid technical jargon. Define acronyms and provide links to specific laws and regulations you may reference.  
      
    
-   Make your statement easy to find by placing it in a prominent and permanent location on your website, such as your primary navigation. 
-   Update your statement after every significant website update and / or redesign. At a minimum, review and update (if necessary) annually to ensure its accuracy remains current.  

Accessibility statements may seem inconsequential, but they carry considerable weight. They show empathy, strengthen your brand, and set the tone for an inclusive digital experience. If you don’t already have one, I hope this blog post has inspired you to begin drafting one.
