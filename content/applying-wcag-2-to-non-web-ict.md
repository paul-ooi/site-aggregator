When we hear the term digital accessibility, many of us immediately think of web accessibility. And we wouldn’t be wrong. However, digital accessibility does not stop at the web. Many digital technologies operate outside of the web, and these non-web information and communication technologies also need to be accessible to people with disabilities. Some examples of these non-web technologies include desktop software and applications, email clients, native iOS and Android apps, as well as self-service ticketing kiosks and ATMs.

Fortunately, there’s guidance available for improving the accessibility of digital technologies beyond the web. The W3C’s [Guidance on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/NOTE-wcag2ict-22-20241115/) helps organizations understand how to apply web-based accessibility standards to non-web Information and Communications Technologies, ICT.

Before we get into some details of WCAG2ICT and how it can be applied, please note: 

> WCAG2ICT is an informative W3C Group Note—it is not normative and does not set requirements. It provides guidance on applying WCAG 2 principles, guidelines, and success criteria to non-web documents and software. 
> 
> If your organization wants to use the information in WCAG2ICT to "help establish standards or regulations regarding accessibility" within your organization's ICTs, the W3C group has provided [these notes to be of assistance](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#comments-on-conformance). ~ [WCAG2ICT Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/)

## What Is WCAG2ICT?

WCAG2ICT provides an authoritative interpretation of how WCAG2 can be applied in various contexts. It provides guidance on the application of the WCAG2 principles, guidelines, and success criteria to non-web ICTs. The latest version of WCAG2ICT was published on October 8, 2024.

## Non-Web ICT Using WCAG2 Success Criteria

### Native iOS app

By applying WCAG2ICT guidance:

-   All buttons and icons have accessible names and roles announced by assistive technology. [SC 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value.html)

-   Text and interface elements have sufficient contrast for users with low vision. [SC 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)

-   Dynamic content updates are announced to assistive technologies without requiring a full-screen refresh. [SC 4.1.3: Status Messages (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/status-messages.html)

-   Navigation is consistent and predictable, with logical grouping of controls and gestures. [SC 3.2.3: Consistent Navigation (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/consistent-navigation) and [SC 2.4.6: Headings and Labels (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html)

### The local ATM

By applying WCAG2ICT guidance:  

-   The ATM includes tactile symbols next to card slots, headphone jacks, and keypads. Additionally, when a user plugs in headphones, the ATM automatically launches an audio interface that describes the available options, enabling blind users to access the same content that is visually displayed on the screen. [SC 1.1.1: Non-text Content (Level A)  
      
    ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html)
-   The on-screen text uses high-contrast color schemes (e.g., white text on a black background or black text on a yellow background) to ensure readability for users with low vision or color blindness. [SC 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)  
      
    ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
-   The ATM features a tactile numeric keypad and navigation keys (up, down, enter, and cancel) that enable users to complete tasks such as checking balances and withdrawing cash without needing to touch the screen. This functionality is crucial for users who are unable to use touch interfaces due to motor disabilities. [SC 2.1.1: Keyboard (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard)

-   The ATM allows users to extend session time or disable automatic timeouts when the audio interface is active, providing individuals with cognitive disabilities or those who read more slowly with extra time to complete transactions. [SC 2.2.1: Timing Adjustable (Level A)  
      
    ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html)
-   On-screen and audio prompts clearly state what is expected at each step. For example, “Please enter your 4-digit PIN, followed by the green Enter button.” These instructions are designed to support users with cognitive disabilities and those unfamiliar with the system.  
    [SC 3.3.2: Labels or Instructions (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html)

## The Benefits of WCAG2ICT Guidance

Applying WCAG 2 success criteria to your non-web ICT offers [the same advantages as making your website accessible](https://dubbot.com/dubblog/2024/prioritize-accessibility-elevate-your-brand.html). By building accessibility into these technologies from the start, organizations can enhance their brand reputation and differentiation, reach a broader customer base, deliver a positive user experience, and foster creativity and innovation, the benefits of which extend across all digital experiences.

## Why WCAG2ICT Matters for Accessibility

Non-web ICT must be accessible too. Under standards such as Section 508 (U.S.) and EN 301 549 (EU), accessibility requirements apply not only to web content but also to non-web ICT, ensuring equal access for people with disabilities in both digital and physical environments.
