With Custom Policies in DubBot, you can easily create tailored checks to keep your content on track. These policies can return a list of pages that either match or don't match a single rule or a set of custom rules. These checks can be simple—such as flagging when the text **Apply Now** is missing from a page—or more complex, involving multiple programmed rules that a page must meet. Custom Policies are a powerful tool to help you in your accessibility workflow.

Just as you would for a new web form, dropdown list, or slider, a Custom Policy can be tested before launching it across your entire site. In DubBot, you can run that test on a single page of your website. Testing your Custom Policy on a single page first is a low-risk, high-reward step to validate functionality before rolling it out site-wide.

And it’s so simple to run that test. While in the app, locate a webpage from your inventoried pages that contains an issue that will trigger your Custom Policy. You can locate that page by selecting the number in the **Pages** column on the list of **Dashboards** page associated with the website where the page lives.

Don’t forget to make sure the website where that page resides is enabled.

Once you have selected the number in the **Pages** column, select the specific page that contains the issue that will trigger your Custom Policy.

Selecting that page will open the [Detailed Page View](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/4211940-view-issues-on-your-webpage "This link leaves the DubBlog website."). Select **Refresh Content**.

If you see a flag appear in [the category of your Custom Policy](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/4054840-create-a-custom-policy#h_45a99e0ea6 "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), you are all set for that policy to begin checking across the site. If you don’t see a flag pop-up, you may want to revisit your Custom Policy configuration. If you need assistance, please contact the Client Support team at [help@dubbot.com](mailto:%20help@dubbot.com) or use the DubBot chatbot.

## Why Test Your Custom Policy Before Using Sitewide?

Just like any other quality check, testing first lets you stay ahead of issues rather than scrambling to fix them later.

Running an untested policy on your whole site could return a flood of false positives—or worse, miss the pages that have the issues you are trying to locate. 

With one simple test run, you can ensure that your Custom Policy flags exactly what you want it to. And when you’re sure your Custom Policy is working as expected, you can trust the results and focus on strategy, continuous improvement, and moving your accessibility goals forward.
