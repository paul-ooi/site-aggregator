Business team huddle with three men and three women with their hands touching in the center.
Many subjects use the mnemonic “5Cs” to identify elements at the core of their definitions.
· Credit has Character, Capacity, Capital, Conditions, and Collateral.
· Marketing has Company, Customers, Competitors, Collaborators, and Climate.
· Diamonds have Carat, Clarity, Color, Cut, and Certificate
So why shouldn’t there be a 5Cs of Accessibility? There were only five Cs when I originally published this article five years ago. Based on the political situation in the US, I’ve added a sixth.
First Accessibility C: Compassion
There is no accessibility without compassion. Compassion is more powerful than empathy because it involves imagining others' difficulties at a deep, personal level. Compassion is more than empathy or surface-level sympathy; it motivates action. Also, compassion is a two-way street. Not only does it benefit the group of people being helped, but it can also fundamentally benefit the person being compassionate.
Whenever you feel your compassion waning, try watching or listening to a video of someone experiencing a sense for the first time. Cochlear implant activation videos still bring me to tears. I have been left speechless when watching people put on EnChroma glasses for the first time. Watch the Sady Apple Accessibility video. Assistive technology has paved the way for the sensations or perceptions in each of these instances, and a key accessibility goal is ensuring that software integrates smoothly with assistive technology.
Second Accessibility C: Collaboration
Accessibility is an exercise in collaboration, as it is a highly cross-functional process. In a mature organization, an accessibility manager may interact and collaborate with up to 13 different departments to achieve the pinnacle of accessibility success—an organization that other companies aspire to emulate. Loosely categorized, these departments include:

Legal: GRC, Policies, Regulatory

Administrative: Procurement, Finance, HR

Product/Service: Design, UX, Development, Testing

Auxiliary: Support, Documentation, Training

Collaboration is easier to initiate when you have an accessibility “elevator pitch.” This is a succinct and persuasive verbal summary explaining the importance of accessibility. Rather than talking about regulations and WCAG, which are relatively dull and dry, think about invoking Helen Keller or Stephen Hawking to help the person you are speaking with build a mental image of what accessibility is all about.
Third Accessibility C: Consistency
Doing what users expect is an essential hallmark of accessibility. Furthermore, Identification and Navigation consistency are required in WCAG 2.0 Level AA. Just a few examples of accessibility consistency include:

Don’t map control-C to do something other than copy.

Don’t use a single-finger flick left to do anything but return to the previous field.

Put the hamburger menu in the same place every time, with the menu items in the same order every time.

Always have the OK and Close buttons on modal dialogs in the same relative places.

Fourth Accessibility C: Customary
To be at the top of your accessibility game, accessibility must be customary at your organization. Customary is “usual practices associated with a particular set of circumstances.” Accessibility is customary at your organization if:

“How do I make it accessible?” is raised in brainstorming sessions at the idea stage or design phase, not at the end.

Accessibility is a thoroughly thought-out, integrated, ongoing process improvement-based program, not a checkbox.

Every employee hears about accessibility at least once (preferably more than once) in early onboarding or training sessions.

Developers and testers are expected to know how to competently use at least one screen reader or other piece of assistive technology.

Fifth Accessibility C: Celebration
When you get an accessibility win, celebrate it! Accessibility wins include (but obviously are not limited to)

Someone on your team (or a vendor’s team) getting IAAP certified

Learning a new piece of assistive technology

Changing “Supports with exceptions” to “Supports” in a VPAT

Incorporating people with disabilities into your testing or user input process

Convincing people to consider accessibility when they couldn’t even spell “accessibility” before they met you.

Saying a public “thank you” and making sure accessibility wins are widely broadcast show appreciation for those who contributed. This also allows you to build on those wins the next time you want to “level up” in accessibility. This is an essential component of creating accessibility champions throughout your organization.
Sixth Accessibility C: Conscience
You can’t think about accessibility in the context of the current political turmoil in the US without thinking about conscience.  Long-standing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives aimed at addressing historical inequities and improving access for marginalized groups are being dismantled in favor of what is termed a strictly merit-based framework. Many argue that this shift overlooks the crucial intersection of conscience and accessibility, where moral commitments to justice and equal opportunity converge. Without this intersection, the ethical obligation to create environments that genuinely serve all individuals falls short. Conversely, the administration’s vague definition of "illegal DEI" has left institutions scrambling to determine whether practices promoting targeted hiring and community support cross the boundary into unlawful preferential treatment. This clash between ethical commitments to inclusivity and politically driven mandates has led to legal and operational uncertainty, compelling organizations to balance their core values with evolving federal directives.
Despite the administration’s current insistence on a narrow focus on merit, maintaining a robust accessibility conscience remains essential. Organizations must commit to practices that actively remove barriers and ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to participate and succeed. This means going beyond mere rhetoric and token gestures to implement genuine policies that support and empower those who have historically been marginalized. Reinforcing systems that enhance access and inclusivity honors ethical obligations while fostering innovation, cohesion, and long-term social progress.
Conclusion
Explaining accessibility can be challenging for those unfamiliar with the concept. With an accessibility “elevator pitch” and a few techniques outlined in this article, you will be well-equipped to discuss accessibility with someone who has no prior knowledge of the subject in a brief amount of time. An accessibility program that embraces Compassion, Collaboration, Custom, Consistency, Celebration, and Conscience is one poised for success.
