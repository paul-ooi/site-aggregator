In December 2024 WebAIM conducted a survey to collect salary and job-related data from professionals whose job responsibilities primarily focus on making technology and digital products accessible and usable to people with disabilities. 656 responses were collected. [The full survey results are now available.](https://webaim.org/projects/salary/)

This survey was conducted in conjunction with the [GAAD Foundation](https://gaad.foundation/). The GAAD Foundation is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to disrupt the culture of technology and digital product development to include accessibility as a core requirement.
