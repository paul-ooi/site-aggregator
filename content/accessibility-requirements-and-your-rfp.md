When writing a Request for Proposal (RFP), it is crucial to include clear and specific accessibility requirements to ensure that the products or services procured are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. At a minimum, the RFP should require that the product or service comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.

All prospective vendors should be required to provide an [Accessibility Conformance Report](https://www.section508.gov/sell/acr/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") (ACR). An ACR details the accessibility of their product as well as components that do not currently meet WCAG standards.

To generate an ACR, vendors should use the [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") (VPAT). A VPAT is "a free template that translates accessibility requirements and standards (e.g., in Section 508 and other legal frameworks) into actionable testing criteria for products and services. Users should test their products and services against each section of the VPAT and use the template to document results." The documented test results then become an ACR.

[Duke University](https://web.accessibility.duke.edu/duke-guidelines/procurement/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") provides this language to be added to all RFPs.

> **Language to include in an RFP:**
> 
> "Please confirm in this proposal that the product/service conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 (minimum Level AA conformance), and describe how this compliance has been verified by providing a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) and/or written description of compatibility of the product/service with commonly used assistive technology products, such as screen readers, and a description of the process used to evaluate such compatibility."

You may also want to consider incorporating these elements:

-   List the specific assistive technologies needed for testing, such as screen readers and voice control.
-   Require mobile accessibility testing.
-   Define expected post-launch accessibility monitoring and support.
-   Ensure accessibility features are available by default for all users.

## Assessing the Response

You should always review an ACR thoroughly, seek clarification from vendors if necessary, and ensure the product meets your users' specific accessibility needs and the organization's compliance obligations.

A well-written VPAT or ACR will have the following characteristics:  

-   **Third-Party Authored** - A third party is less familiar with the product than the vendor, which allows them to provide an objective report.
-   **Testing Methodology** - Explains how the vendor conducted the accessible testing.
-   **Assistive Technology Testing** - Testing with a wide range of assistive technologies demonstrates a comprehensive evaluation approach.
-   **Examples** - Providing examples of how a product aligns with a success criterion demonstrates the vendor's understanding of that criterion.
-   **Publicly Available** - can you find the vendor's VPAT or ACR on their website?

You should conduct independent conformance validation testing and evaluation whenever possible to verify vendor accessibility conformance claims. If your organization does not have dedicated accessibility personnel, consider hiring a web accessibility consultant to assist in evaluating VPATs and ACRs.

A good RFP clearly states that all information and communication technology (ICT) procured must meet applicable accessibility standards and requires all vendors to provide detailed information and examples of how their products or services comply and meet the needs of your organization and its users.
