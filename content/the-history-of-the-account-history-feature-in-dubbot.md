Less than a year ago, a client contacted our support line with an unusual situation…users were "disappearing from the platform." Multiple inquiries had come from colleagues who had been set up in DuBot but had now disappeared and no longer had access. 

After some sleuthing, DubBot engineers determined that it was "possible that an admin inadvertently removed users, but we (DubBot) do not currently track those events."

In January 2024, DubBot launched the Account History feature, which tracks when users are added or removed from their DubBot account, including who took the action. The feature also tracks ignoring and unignoring issues.

## Fast forward to May 09, 2025

Imagine how excited we were to see this post from one of our engineers in the DubBot #productupdate channel: "Show Site changes in Account History—It's awesome!"

That’s right! If you can access Account History in DubBot, you can now track site changes! 🎉

The options include, All account-wide history events, User authentication, issues ignored/unignored, sites settings, user settings, page sets settings, connectors settings, report settings and policies settings.](../../images/blog-content/2025/account-history-choices.png)

Changes you can track for sites include creating / deleting sites, enabling / disabling sites for checking (crawling), enabling PDF checking, and page set membership—any actions that can be applied to your sites can be tracked.

DubBot instantly records any changes to your site. In the Changes column, you will see an icon in the shape of a human eye.

Clicking the "eye" icon provides a pop-up window with the details of the change, which include the message listed on the Site changes panel, the user who made the change, the date the change was made, and what the change was. In the screenshot below, the change was "Crawler Configuration - Obey Robots Txt."

DubBot has rapidly expanded the Account History feature from four to eight trackable items, making it even easier to maintain a clear audit trail for regulatory compliance and troubleshooting purposes.

The data in the Account History feature is also valuable for maintaining user accountability, reporting user activity, and providing error recovery and rollback support.
