Budgeting for accessibility is a deliberate, forward-looking process. It requires understanding _why_ accessibility matters, planning for the real costs involved, and thoughtfully allocating resources over time.

## Why Accessibility Requires a Dedicated Budget

From a risk perspective, accessibility is just like any other regulatory concern, like data privacy, environmental standards, etc. 

Digital accessibility enforcement already has a strong hold at the federal level with regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ, which enforces Title II and Title III of the ADA), the U.S. Access Board (sets the technical accessibility standards, including Section 508), and the General Services Administration (GSA, which oversees Section 508 compliance for federal agencies). 

And enforcement is becoming increasingly active at the state and local levels, with the [DOJ’s final rule updating Title II](https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") of the Americans with Disabilities Act to _ensure that web content and mobile applications (apps) are accessible to people with disabilities_.

Treating accessibility as a reactive effort will lead to higher long-term costs due to emergency remediations, litigation, or lost contracts and / or customers. 

By contrast, Organizations that plan and budget smartly don’t just reduce risk, they boost operational efficiency. The result? Websites that are easier to use and maintain, and perform better, support SEO goals, and deliver stronger user experiences. All while building customer loyalty and [strengthening the brand](../2024/prioritize-accessibility-elevate-your-brand.html).

## What’s Included in an Accessibility Budget?

A mature accessibility budget would include these common cost categories:

-   **audits and testing** - automated and manual testing.  
      
    
-   **remediation** - correcting websites, PDFs, other digital documents, and apps, if appropriate.  
      
    
-   **training** - accessibility training for designers, developers, content creators, and the marketing, procurement, and IT teams. [Accessibility is everyone’s responsibility](the-first-rule-of-accessibility-accessibility-is-everyones-responsibility.html).  
      
    
-   **tools and platforms** - accessibility testing software, document remediation tools, and assistive technology for manual testing.  
      
    
-   **expert support** - accessibility consultant or [embedded accessibility professional](the-first-rule-of-accessibility-accessibility-is-everyones-responsibility.html) to guide strategy, governance, and provide leadership for complex remediation efforts.

An accessibility budget should also account for:

-   Major redesigns or platform migrations.
-   New system procurements or vendor contracts.
-   Ongoing content publishing and document creation.
-   Periodic reassessments as standards and technologies evolve.

## When and How Much to Invest

When to invest is easy. The most cost-effective time to fund accessibility is **early and continuously**. [Shift left on accessibility](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/what-it-means-shift-left-accessibility-and-how-do-it-right "This link leaves the DubBlog website.").

[According to the W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/plan/#determine-budget-and-resources "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") _Your budget and resource needs depend on your accessibility goals and the extent of the work required to achieve them._

There’s no one-size-fits-all budget number, but according to [Karl Groves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlgroves/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") in his article [_How much should you spend on accessibility_](https://karlgroves.com/how-much-should-you-spend-on-accessibility/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.")?, rough industry signals can help:

-   Large enterprises often spend **hundreds of thousands to millions** per year on accessibility.
-   Mid-sized orgs may carve out **$50k–$250k/year** depending on the digital footprint.
-   Smaller teams can make meaningful progress with **project-based investments** like $5k–$25k/year.

He goes on to say _Aiming for 5%–10% of your compliance budget is a solid starting point. For some, that may mean 0.1%–0.5% of total revenue—a modest investment compared to the potential costs of inaction._

**Note:** See [Chris Hinds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophermhinds/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.")’ webinar [How to Accurately Budget for Accessibility](https://equalizedigital.com/how-to-accurately-budget-for-accessibility-chris-hinds/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") for a detailed view and scenario-based budget projections.

## A Strategic Investment in Compliance

It’s easy to ask what accessibility costs. The harder and more important question is [what inaccessibility costs](../2024/want-to-save-money-make-your-website-accessible.html).

In his webinar [How to Accurately Budget for Accessibility](https://equalizedigital.com/how-to-accurately-budget-for-accessibility-chris-hinds/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), [Chris Hinds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophermhinds/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") of Equalize Digital states _An organization’s budget is the purest reflection of its priorities._

That’s a powerful reminder of what accessibility funding truly is. It's an investment in fairness and inclusion so everyone, regardless of ability, can fully access and use digital resources. It’s a clear statement of an organization's values, long-term responsibility, and the building of digital experiences that work for everybody.
