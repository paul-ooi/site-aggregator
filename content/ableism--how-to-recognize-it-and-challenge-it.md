I try not to begin a blog post with a definition. In fact, some folks have told me it’s just not good form. But in this particular case, I feel it’s necessary. The subject of **ableism**, the word itself, even **...does a lot of work for disability culture. It carries the weight of the worst of what plagues disabled people the most, but can be so hard to express.** ~ [Words Matter, And It’s Time To Explore The Meaning Of Ableism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewpulrang/2020/10/25/words-matter-and-its-time-to-explore-the-meaning-of-ableism/), Forbes Magazine

And for that reason, I am including a definition of ableism at the beginning of this post.

I prefer the [Urban Dictionary definition](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ableism). It’s written in plain language and is easy to understand, making it accessible. That clarity also makes it easier for people to recognize and identify what may be happening in their workplace, their day-to-day activities, or even among friends.

> Ableism is the discrimination or prejudice against people who have disabilities. Ableism can take the form of ideas and assumptions, stereotypes, attitudes and practices, physical barriers in the environment, or larger-scale oppression. It is oftentimes unintentional and most people are completely unaware of the impact of their words or actions.

Ableism comes in many forms, from blatant acts of discrimination to subtle biases, and sometimes it’s built into the very systems we rely on every day. In this section, we’ll break down each form and explain what each looks like.

## Overt Ableism

Overt ableism is the most obvious and direct form of discrimination against disabled people. It includes explicit actions, words, or policies that demean, exclude, or mistreat someone because of their disability. Things like mocking someone’s speech pattern, refusing to hire a qualified person because they use a wheelchair, or saying someone is less capable because of their disability. This form of ableism is easy to spot. It is open, intentional, and often rooted in stereotypes or prejudice.  

## Subtle Ableism

Subtle ableism refers to the everyday comments, behaviors, and assumptions that may not seem openly discriminatory but still reinforce negative stereotypes or the exclusion of people with disabilities. Things like constant comments about someone **overcoming** their disability or helping without asking, which disrespects a person's independence.

Subtle ableism also involves **ignoring accessibility**. Whether that’s in planning an event, creating digital content, or designing spaces. And then there are times when it comes across as misplaced sentiment, seeing disability as either **tragic** or **inspiring**.

Subtle ableism can be hard to recognize because it’s woven into everyday language and behavior. But its impact can still be just as harmful.

## Systemic Ableism

Systemic ableism refers to how societal structures, policies, and institutions, like education systems that do not provide services, healthcare systems that fail to respect disabled patients' autonomy, hiring practices, transportation systems, and government, create barriers for people with disabilities. Unlike overt or subtle ableism, which focuses on individual attitudes or actions, systemic ableism is embedded in society's rules, norms, and designs. It makes up inaccessible public spaces, inflexible workplace policies, a lack of accommodations in schools, and digital products that have not been designed with accessibility in mind.

Simply put, systemic ableism is when the system itself favors people without disabilities, often unintentionally, making it difficult for people with disabilities to fully participate in everyday life.

## How to Challenge Ableism

To challenge ableism, start by assessing your own assumptions and making the necessary changes. Think about the language you use daily. What is the origin of some of those **old sayings** or slang terms that you use?

Advocate for accessible spaces, both physical and digital. And remember: Always ask before offering help, respecting each person’s independence.

Educate yourself and others about disability issues, and regularly audit spaces from websites to workplaces.
