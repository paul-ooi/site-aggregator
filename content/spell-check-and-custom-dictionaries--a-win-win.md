Misspelled words damage credibility and erode trust — they also disrupt user flow and negatively impact search engine rankings.

Maintaining proper spelling across your website is a strategic advantage. Leveraging DubBot’s universal spell checker and customizable dictionaries can elevate your user experience, web governance, and SEO.

## User Experience

Whether a simple blog post or an in-depth news article, typos and inconsistent spelling can severely disrupt a user’s experience, leaving them confused, frustrated, and probably not very impressed with your website.

-   Users are more likely to trust and engage with a site that’s polished and free of errors.  
      
    
-   Consistent spelling enhances readability for screen readers and other assistive technologies.  
      
    
-   Correct spelling aids in users' understanding of your message, especially for users with lower literacy levels or for whom English is a second language. 

## Web Governance

Web governance is about maintaining organizational standards, consistency, and quality across your website. 

DubBot’s universal spell checker, paired with your custom dictionaries, makes it easier to enforce editorial guidelines across teams. For example, you can maintain consistency across faculty pages on a university website by creating a custom dictionary of department names, academic programs, and subject-specific terminology.

Custom dictionaries can also include multiple languages, and you can add custom-flagged words to DubBot’s default list to ensure your content editors aren't using outdated terminology or offensive phrases and words.

### Making the Most of Your Custom Dictionaries

Regularly update your custom dictionary with brand-specific and industry-specific terms, acronyms, and preferred spellings.

Did you know you can add words to your dictionary [while in detailed Page View](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/6789598-add-a-word-to-a-site-s-dictionary-from-a-page-view "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") in the DubBot app? Here’s how:

## Search Engine Optimization

Search engines reward clarity and relevance. Poor spelling can hurt both. While Google does not penalize spelling and grammar, Bing prioritizes error-free content. Correct spelling is essential for credibility and relevance in terms of SEO.

-   Misspelled keywords may prevent pages from ranking properly, especially for long-tail search terms.  
      
    
-   Sloppy content in meta descriptions or Search Engine Results Page (SERP) previews can turn users away.  
      
    
-   Users who spot multiple spelling errors may quickly leave your website, increasing your bounce rate — a negative signal for search engines.  
      
    
-   Don’t forget your metadata. Meta descriptions and titles with spelling errors can appear unprofessional or spammy in search results, discouraging users from clicking your link.

By integrating your custom dictionaries alongside DubBot's universal spell checker into your accessibility monitoring strategy, you can build trust with your users, ensure consistency, and enhance discoverability.
