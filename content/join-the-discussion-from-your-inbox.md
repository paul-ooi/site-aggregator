Which WebAIM resource had its 25th birthday on November 1, 2024? The answer is our [Web Accessibility Email Discussion List](https://webaim.org/discussion/)! From the halcyon days when Hotmail had over 35 million users, to our modern era where Gmail has 2.5 billion users, the amount of emails in most inboxes has gone from a trickle to a flood. Over the last quarter century WebAIM has delivered over 80 million distinct emails to our list subscribers—currently over 2000 strong. These emails allow subscribers to participate in accessibility discussions across space and time. 

## Who is the discussion list for? 

The WebAIM email discussion list is for anyone interested in discussing web accessibility issues. It’s a forum where those just starting out in the field can ask basic questions, where seasoned pros can pose deep-dive questions, and everything in between. It’s a great resource for learning about recent fixes for accessibility issues in digital tools, job opportunities in the accessibility field, virtual webinars, and free or low-cost resources. 

## Do I have to post my questions to get answers? 

Nope. The [archives](https://webaim.org/discussion/archives) have every one of over 48,000 questions and replies that have been posted so far, organized by month and year. Want to know what the hot topics were when [Barbenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbenheimer) was in theaters, just click on the link for [July 2023](https://webaim.org/discussion/mail_archive?sort_by=2&srch_mnth=7&srch_yr=2023). And, hey, if you can read one message a minute and don’t sleep or eat (not recommended), you can read them all in about a month. For a more targeted approach, we’ve recently updated our [search tool](https://webaim.org/discussion/archives#searchterms) to select the most relevant messages for your keywords. 

## What’s kept the discussion list going? 

Our contributors! Without regular contributors that share their knowledge about and passion for increasing web accessibility, there would be nothing to subscribe to, and no archives to explore. To those of you that have been a part of the discussion list, whether for decades or for days, we say “thank you” from the bottom of our hearts. 

## What’s on the horizon—anything new in the works? 

Great question! Our team has discussed a few ideas, such as creating different interest groups for topics like technical frameworks (e.g., WCAG), accessibility in digital documents, and assistive technologies (e.g., NVDA). The reality is we’re counting on the community to help us navigate the path forward, and we hope you’ll join us. 

## Where can I share my feedback? 

We’d love to hear from you in the comments below. If you’re already a subscriber, it’s a great place to give a quick “shout out” to your favorite contributor or share an experience you’ve had. You can also send your suggestions and/or thoughts to the team on [our Contact page](https://webaim.org/contact/#sender).
