The **Analyze** feature just got an upgrade. Previously, full-site re-analysis was handled behind the scenes by the DubBot team. Thanks to valuable client feedback, account and site-level administrators can now run a complete **Analyze** across their entire site, right from within their DubBot account.

On the Manage Sites Panel, in the Action column, account and site-level administrators will now see the **Analyze** icon located between the Crawl button and the kebab menu.

All this while still providing all DubBot users with single-page **Analyze** capability at the page level.

## How Does the Upgraded Analyze Work?

This newly available **Analyze** feature lets you re-run checks across your site without re-crawling every page. It does this by running those checks on the cached pages in the site from the previous crawl. That means faster updates and fresher results in a fraction of the time it takes for a full crawl.

The **Analyze** feature is most helpful in obtaining updated results from new or revised policies applied to your site.

Note: The **Analyze** option will not be available in the Manage Sites Panel if the site is not enabled or is currently being crawled.

This update is all about giving admins more control, more insight, and more speed. All powered by your feedback.
