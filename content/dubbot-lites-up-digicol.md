Who says conferences are all business? Some bring swag, we brought 150 Lite Brites as give-aways. At this year’s [Digital Colloquium](https://events.digicol.org/digicol25/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), DubBot traded laptops for pegs and let creativity take the lead.

The results? A mashup of bold colors, familiar images, classic favorites, and wonderfully quirky scenes. The Lite Brites didn’t just light up the (IKEA) bookshelves; they lit up the whole room.

Nothing sparks the imagination like a good ol' fashioned, iconic childhood toy… plus some low-stakes bragging rights.

And to top it all off, one of our clients, [Kimberly Vlies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberlyvlies/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") from the [University of Wisconsin-Green Bay](https://www.uwgb.edu/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), surprised us with a super cool thank-you gift. A [DubBot-branded Brite Lite Template](pdf/Dubbot-lite-brite-ultimate-classic.pdf "This link leaves the DubBlog website."). (PDF) Genius!

Who knew a tiny peg would bring this much shine to DigiCol?

Will we ever do it again? Probably not. We hadn’t considered the need to put batteries in all of those Lite Brites until we got to the conference. That led us to scrambling to put three AAAs into each Lite Brite before the show actually opened. It was still worth it in the end.
