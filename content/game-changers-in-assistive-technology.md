I was offline all day last week for a small road trip. On the drive home, I was thinking about what the next blog post should be about. I keep a running list of topics on my computer, and while driving down I-95, I was running through that list in my mind.  

The next morning, after logging in and checking my email, I went to the DubBot Slack board to catch up on everything I missed the previous day while still thinking about that list.

I clicked open one of the channels and saw that my colleague [Joanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanie-chembars-75718a52/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") had shared a picture of a familiar sight: a box of Kellogg's cereal she had purchased at her local grocery store. But this wasn't just any cereal box. Prominently displayed on the packaging was a distinct, colorful square—a [NaviLens](https://www.navilens.com/en/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") code.

Next to the cell phone is a white panel with black text. The text reads - This box features NaviLens technology to assist blind and low-vision adults in the U.S. with NaviLens code and app, user can now easily find this product and hear its name, nutrition and allergen information. Kellog is proud to be the first food company to feature this technology on its packaging in the U.S. Accessibility: part of our commitment to create better days for 3 billion people by the end of 2030.](../../images/blog-content/2025/cereal-box.jpg)

My focus sharpened; I would write about how cutting-edge assistive technologies are fundamentally transforming how people with disabilities interact with their environment, communicate, and pursue their goals, ultimately leading to more self-sufficient lives.

BTW, two of these were unveiled at the recent [CSUN Assistive Technology Conference](https://web.cvent.com/event/2c5d8c51-6441-44c0-b361-131ff9544dd5/summary "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") in Anaheim, California.

## Audible Wayfinding and Labeling

[NaviLens](https://www.navilens.com/en/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.")  
NaviLens is a groundbreaking labeling and signage solution for individuals with visual impairments. Key features include a free, downloadable smartphone app; the ability to detect tags in motion, at a distance, and from any angle; reliable performance in all lighting conditions; and automatic reading of information in the user's preferred language without requiring camera focus. 

NaviLens is also used for food labels. Users can now find the product, hear the name, and see nutritional information. Coca-Cola UK became the first beverage brand to pilot Navilens technology for the visually impaired.

## Hands-free control at the roll of the tongue

This one just blew me away! Simply blew me away. How absolutely amazing!

[Augmental’s MouthPad](https://www.augmental.tech/)^  
Imagine controlling your digital devices with just your tongue! MouthPad^ is a wireless Bluetooth touchpad custom-molded for comfortable placement on the palate that allows users to control digital devices with tongue movements.

> **CSUN Highlights  
> **The MouthPad^ captivated attendees as one of the most innovative exhibits at the conference. Stories included students completing assignments, veterans reconnecting with loved ones, and artists designing digital content—all independently and hands-free.

You have to see it for yourself.

## Sign Language and Captions Built Right In

This one especially caught my attention. I have been hard of hearing for almost 20 years and have worn hearing aids for about 8 years.

[SignGlasses](https://www.signglasses.com/)  
By leveraging augmented reality, SignGlasses smart glasses deliver live ASL interpretation and captioning as a visual overlay. The intuitive interface, featuring a precise and responsive floating video feed or caption display, eliminates the need to shift focus, ensuring a natural and engaging experience.

> **CSUN Highlights  
> **Attendees who tried SignGlasses described the experience as seamless and user-friendly. Feedback from educators and professionals emphasized how the technology enhances accessibility in fast-paced or visually complex environments. ~[Top 5 Assistive Technologies Showcased at CSUN 2025](https://www.innocaption.com/recentnews/top-5-assistive-technologies-csun-2025)

These tools and others like them empower users to navigate their environments, access information, and connect with others in previously impossible ways. As technology expands, I hope to see even more groundbreaking solutions to further enhance the lives and opportunities for people of all abilities.
