Tomorrow, October 1st, marks a significant milestone in WebAIM’s 25 year history of expanding the potential of the web for people with disabilities. In partnership with our colleagues at the [Institute for Disability Research, Policy & Practice](https://idrpp.usu.edu/) at Utah State University, we’re launching a new technical assistance center. The National Center on Accessible Digital Educational Materials & Instruction (NCADEMI) will help improve access to technology and learning for students with disabilities from preschool through high school graduation. Our initialism, NCADEMI, is pronounced “n-cademy.” 

Funded by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) at the U.S. Department of Education, NCADEMI will apply WebAIM’s expertise and tools to develop free resources for the evaluation, procurement, selection, creation, and use of accessible digital educational materials and instruction in PreK–12. With WebAIM’s 25 years of digital accessibility service to organizations worldwide, we are uniquely poised to support states and school districts with meeting the compliance deadlines of the [April, 2024, ADA Title II final rule](https://webaim.org/blog/impact-of-rulemaking/). In fact, a related _[Roadmap for State and Local Educational Agencies](https://ncademi.org/roadmap.html)_ is one of NCADEMI’s first resources.
