Delivering web and digital accessibility in any environment requires strategic planning and cross-organizational commitment. While the goal (ensuring that websites and digital platforms do not present barriers to individuals with disabilities) and the standards (the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) remain constant, implementation must be tailored to each organization’s needs and context.  

For K–12 educational agencies, including state educational agencies (SEAs) and school districts, digital accessibility efforts must align with existing priorities, practices, and policies. A one-size-fits-all approach simply won’t work. 

## A Foundation in Special Education and Alternatives to Print Materials 

Since 1975, the [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/) has required that students with disabilities be provided access to the general education curriculum. When IDEA was last reauthorized in 2004, it included a provision that SEAs and districts provide accessible formats of print materials—such as braille, large print, digital text, and audio—to eligible students with disabilities. 

Each SEA is required to define what constitutes a “timely manner” for providing accessible formats. Most states have adopted a definition that aligns with the expectation that students with disabilities receive accessible formats _at the same time_ as their peers without disabilities receive the print version of the materials. 

To help meet this requirement, Congress established the National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard (NIMAS) and the National Instructional Materials Access Center (NIMAC). Together, [NIMAS and the NIMAC](https://ncademi.org/resources/publications/nimas-nimac-seas-leas/) have supported the timely delivery of accessible formats in K–12 settings for nearly two decades. 

## The Shift to Digital and New Challenges for Accessibility 

While IDEA remains grounded in the early 2000s, the instructional landscape in K-12 schools has rapidly shifted from print to digital. Relative to most higher education institutions, SEAs and school districts haven’t kept pace with digital accessibility. One reason for this lies in the differences between the primary disability laws that govern K–12 versus higher education. In K–12, IDEA guarantees a free appropriate public education (FAPE), which includes an individualized education program (IEP) and specially designed instruction. This model often includes **individualized assistance** to address the daily accessibility issues experienced by students with disabilities. For example, a paraprofessional might assist a student whose assistive technology doesn’t work with an inaccessible website assigned for homework. These interventions, although understandable in context, have interfered with progress toward removing digital barriers in K-12.   

By contrast, in higher education, the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/) emphasizes equal access through **reasonable accommodations**. While accommodations should be individually designed to meet the access needs of the student with a disability, the ADA states that accommodations are not required when they would result in a fundamental alteration of the student’s educational program. Because postsecondary students with disabilities are expected to make educational progress with considerable independence, higher ed institutions have had to be proactive with digital accessibility to ensure equitable and effective access to course materials and platforms.  

## ADA Title II Raises the Bar for Digital Accessibility in K–12 

The [recent ADA Title II final rule](https://webaim.org/blog/impact-of-rulemaking/) makes it clear that the responsibilities of SEAs and school districts extend beyond providing accessible formats. Under the ADA, the digital educational materials provided by schools must meet specific accessibility standards by either April 24, 2026 (SEAs and larger school districts) or April 26, 2027 (smaller school districts). This is a significant challenge for schools that have been operating for decades under the model of individualized accommodations required by IDEA. 

## Partnering for Progress: NCADEMI 

WebAIM is proud to partner with the [National Center on Accessible Digital Educational Materials & Instruction (NCADEMI)](https://ncademi.org/), pronounced “n-cademy,” to help SEAs and school districts meet ADA Title II requirements. Launched on October 1, 2024, and funded by the Office of Special Education Programs at the U.S. Department of Education, NCADEMI supports the timely provision and effective use of accessible digital materials for learners with disabilities, from early intervention through high school graduation. 

### Free Tools and Training from NCADEMI 

NCADEMI provides a range of no-cost resources and training to help education agencies meet digital accessibility obligations, including:

### What’s Next: Quality Indicators and Implementation Tools 

As NCADEMI approaches its second year, we’re preparing to launch the _Quality Indicators for the Provision and Use of Accessible Materials in PreK–12 Systems_. These will include research-based readiness protocols and self-assessment tools designed specifically for SEAs and school districts. Virtual coaching on best practices for implementing the Quality Indicators will be available to SEA and district teams starting in October 2025.
