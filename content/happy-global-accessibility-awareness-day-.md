Tomorrow, May 15, is [Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)](https://accessibility.day/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.")—a day to shine a light on digital access and inclusion for the more than one billion people worldwide living with disabilities and impairments.

[How will you be celebrating](https://accessibility.day/events/#this-years-events "This link leaves the DubBlog website.")?

Are you planning an awareness event to engage your team or community? Or perhaps you're preparing a blog post or website resource to showcase your commitment to accessibility.

Consider joining our webinar, _"_[_Mastering Digital Accessibility—A Partner Webinar_](https://resource.prometsource.com/mastering-digital-accessibility "This links leaves the DubBlog website."),_"_ presented in collaboration with [Promet Source](https://www.prometsource.com/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."). Hear from CPWA and CPACC-certified experts as they discuss the vital roles that both automated and manual testing play in ensuring accessibility compliance.

However you mark the day, remember that the purpose of GAAD is to get everyone talking, thinking, and learning about digital accessibility.

A human author creates the DubBlog posts. The AI tool Gemini is sometimes used to brainstorm subject ideas, generate blog post outlines, and rephrase certain portions of the content. Our marketing team carefully reviews all final drafts for accuracy and authenticity. The opinions and perspectives expressed remain the sole responsibility of the human author.
