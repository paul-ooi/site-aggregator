Drupal is a powerful, enterprise-grade CMS. It’s flexible, scalable, and trusted by organizations with big, complex digital footprints. Managing all that content and complexity can be a significant challenge. DubBot simplifies things for Drupal users by automating accessibility checks and streamlining quality assurance. For Drupal users, DubBot is the ideal project partner, helping teams maintain accessible, usable, and inclusive content.

## The Drupal Module Integration

DubBot offers [a dedicated Drupal Module](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/9688844-dubbot-drupal-module "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") that makes connecting Drupal sites with DubBot’s scanning engine effortless. With just a few clicks, site administrators can securely integrate their Drupal instance, automatically syncing content for accessibility and quality assurance checks. This eliminates the need for manual configuration or workarounds, allowing teams to focus on improving content rather than managing connections.

The module aligns with Drupal’s modular philosophy: it installs like any other contributed module, leverages Drupal’s permissions system for role-based access, and requires minimal setup. Once enabled, DubBot scans are automatically applied to the site's content, blocks, and modules.

Here are some specific ways in which Drupal users benefit from the simplicity and power of DubBot.

## Perfect Fit for Frequent Updates

The most common adopters of Drupal are higher education and government. These sites can often be large, decentralized, and content-heavy, making it difficult to keep accessibility, quality, and web governance on track.

DubBot’s automated, scheduled scans make it simple, catching issues in new content, blocks, and modules early, which makes it easier for distributed content teams to maintain consistent standards across thousands of nodes.

## Custom Policies for Flexibility

DubBot lets organizations enforce custom quality assurance [using Custom Policies](https://dubbot.com/dubblog/2025/quality-check-for-your-custom-policies.html). With these, users build content checks tailored to their needs. Checks may cover accessibility, like ALT text that matches a file name. They can enforce style guides, for example, making class year terms lowercase: first-year, sophomore, junior, senior. They can also optimize SEO by flagging long titles or descriptions that may hinder click-through rates. You can even use XPath and regular expression (regex) rules to find specific words or patterns across the entire site.

This flexibility pairs perfectly with Drupal’s modular nature, enabling teams to maintain consistency across sites, even when different themes or contributed modules are in use.

One client remarked: 

> Policies have the flexibility of CSS selectors, XPath, or regular expressions in addition to conventional content matching, which made our migration from our legacy platform an easy move.

## Multi-Domain Coverage

Many Drupal shops run multisite installations that consist of a single codebase and multiple domains. DubBot’s architecture supports monitoring multiple domains and sites under one account.

One client remarked: 

> I've used Dubbot to help monitor accessibility on a large number of websites, and would say it's indispensable. Between its friendly dashboard, email reports, CSV exports, and so many more useful features, I couldn't imagine doing website accessibility audits and general compliance of existing sites without it.

## WCAG Checks Without the Guesswork

Drupal is a leading CMS for accessibility-minded organizations. DubBot builds on that with WCAG-driven scans, clear page-level reports, and severity-based prioritization, helping Drupal users deliver on their accessibility promises.

One client remarked:

> DubBot makes accessibility actionable with clear reports and prioritization.

## Smooth Workflow Integration

Unlike general site checkers, DubBot provides content editors with simple dashboards to address issues such as missing ALT text, unclear link text, and broken links, requiring no coding knowledge. Developers, meanwhile, receive the deeper technical insights that are necessary for advanced theme or module fixes. This tailored dual support aligns with Drupal’s editor + developer workflow, making DubBot uniquely effective for both roles.

## Scalable for Drupal’s Core Market

In support of Drupal’s emphasis on enterprise-level governance, DubBot streamlines the implementation and monitoring of quality assurance and accessibility standards by providing centralized oversight and automated testing, ensuring these standards are consistently applied across even the largest and most complex site structures. This is particularly critical in higher education and government, where sites often span multiple domains, departments, and content contributors.

As you can see, DubBot gives Drupal users a unique advantage: the confidence to manage even the most complex, multisite setups through its automated compliance checks and governance dashboards. By supporting custom governance, empowering both editors and developers, and scaling effortlessly across large institutional sites, DubBot builds on Drupal’s reputation as the go-to CMS for accessibility-conscious organizations.

A human author creates the DubBlog posts. The AI tool Gemini is sometimes used to brainstorm subject ideas, generate blog post outlines, and rephrase certain portions of the content. Our marketing team carefully reviews all final drafts for accuracy and authenticity. The opinions and perspectives expressed remain the sole responsibility of the human author.
