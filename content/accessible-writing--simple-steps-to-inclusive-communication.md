Have you ever noticed that most WCAG accessibility standards emphasize how content is delivered, not the content itself? While [Section Headings (2.4.10)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/section-headings.html "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") and [Reading Level (3.1.5)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reading-level.html "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") relate to content, they are Level AAA criteria. Generally, compliance organizations like the ADA consider Level AA sufficient for compliance.

## So why does accessible content matter?

> "Because no matter how accessible the equipment, platform, application and coding is – if the reader cannot understand the content — the rest of the work is useless for that user." ~ [Opinion: Well Written Content Plays a Critical Role in Accessibility and Usability So Why Aren't We Talking About it?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/opinion-well-written-content-plays-critical-role-so-rachael/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), [Rachael Bradley Montgomery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachael-bradley-montgomery-ph-d-6847144/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), Ph.D., Accessibility Advocate

## Techniques to Make Written Content More Accessible

We’ll examine a short list of techniques you can use today to create more accessible, usable content. This list is in no way exhaustive. I encourage you to review the resource provided at the end of this blog post for more information and additional techniques.

### Bias-Free Language

Bias-free language, or inclusive language, refers to words and phrases free from prejudices, stereotypes, or discriminatory implications.

Key principles of bias-free language include:

-   [**Person-first language**](../2024/understanding-person-first-and-identity-first-language.html): Emphasizing the individual rather than defining them by a specific characteristic. For example, instead of "The autistic person," one would say "The person with autism."
-   [**Identity-first language**](../2024/understanding-person-first-and-identity-first-language.html): In some communities, individuals prefer identity-first language. For example, one would say "A blind person" instead of "A person who is blind." It's essential to be aware of and respect these preferences when known.
-   **Using inclusive terminology**: Choose language that honors diverse identities and experiences while avoiding the reinforcement of stereotypes, using the terminology that individuals and groups use to identify themselves. Consult the American Psychological Association's [Inclusive Language Guide](https://www.apa.org/about/apa/equity-diversity-inclusion/language-guidelines "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") for more detailed guidance.
-   **Being specific when relevant**: Use respectful and accurate terms for racial and ethnic groups, avoid outdated or offensive language, and mention race or ethnicity only when relevant.

### Plain Language

Using plain language does not mean you have to oversimplify your content. Instead, it means considering your audience's existing knowledge and using language that resonates with them.

Using plain language can help your users:

-   "Find what they need."
-   "Understand what they find."
-   "Use what they find to meet their needs."

The [Center for Plain Language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") provides guidance.

### Use of Headings

SC 2.4.10: Section Headings (Level AAA) addresses the need for headings to make webpages and other document types more accessible. For instance, long documents are typically structured with chapters and subtopics, necessitating clear headings for each section. These headings expose the document's organization, simplify navigation, and create mental cues for better understanding.

For specific guidance, see [Technique G141: Organizing a page using headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G141 "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") from the W3C.

### Avoiding Directional Language

-   Avoid phrases like "see below" or "refer to the right."
-   Remember: Responsive websites shift elements around.
-   The [HRSA Style Guide on Directional Language](https://www.hrsa.gov/design/style-guide/directional-language "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") offers specific guidance.

## Tools for Testing: DubBot Checks and Custom Policies

The DubBot app helps you create accessible writing that aligns with current standards by offering [Readability Scoring and Custom Hotwords Lists](../../features/spelling-readability-checks.html). Readability Scoring identifies potentially dense and verbose content. DubBot employs six different readability scoring tools to analyze your text.

![Count, Letter Count, Syllable Count, Avg Words per Sentence, Avg Syllables per sentence, and the following readability testing: Flesch Reading Ease Score, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, automated Readability Index or ARI, Coleman-Liau Index, Gunning Fog Index and the SMOG Grade Index](../../images/blog-content/2025/View-Issues-on-Your-Webpage-DubBot-Help-Center-Pages-Help-Center-DubBot-04-14-2025_08_09_AM.png)

Starting with the DubBot default hotword list, define your words and phrases to identify and correct stereotypes, prejudice, and discriminatory language, ensuring respectful and accurate communication.

![Some of the policies included in the DubBot default hotword list, named Journey Toward Eliminating Oppressive Language, are blackbox, blacklist, mob programming, master/slave.](../../images/blog-content/2025/custom-hotwords.png)

By consciously implementing these techniques and others found in the provided resources, you're not only removing barriers but also enhancing your content's overall quality and reach. Your commitment to accessible writing will generate considerable benefits through enhanced inclusivity, audience engagement, and, ultimately, a more impactful message.

A human author creates the DubBlog posts. The AI tool Gemini is sometimes used to brainstorm subject ideas, generate blog post outlines, and rephrase certain portions of the content. Our marketing team carefully reviews all final drafts for accuracy and authenticity. The opinions and perspectives expressed remain the sole responsibility of the human author.
