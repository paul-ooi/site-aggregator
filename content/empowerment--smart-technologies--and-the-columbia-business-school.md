At DubBot, we get excited when organizations blend accessibility and bold leadership into their digital strategies—and even more so when it’s one of our clients leading the charge.

[David Moretti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-moretti/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), Senior Director of Digital Marketing and Technology with [Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/ "This link leaves the DubBlog website."), [penned a recent article](https://marketing-services.educationinsidermagazine.com/cxoinsight/building-digital-excellence-through-team-empowerment-nwid-411.html "This link leaves the DubBlog website.") sharing his leadership philosophy, which includes accessibility-first strategies, agile team development and empowerment, and **aligning digital tools with user-centered outcomes and institutional goals**.

## Empowering Teams to Do Their Best Work

One of the key takeaways from Dave’s approach is his emphasis on empowerment. Empowering teams with the right insights and tools, they can do more than respond to problems—they can stay ahead of them. That’s a significant shift from a reactive to a proactive approach.

## The Right Tools for the Right Job

Teams need the right tools to stay on course. Columbia Business School’s digital team understands that and leverages smart technology, enabling them to stay agile and responsive.

This balanced approach ensures technologies not only meet technical needs but also align with institutional constraints. ~ Dave Moretti

That’s why we’re proud that DubBot is part of their toolkit—helping to simplify quality assurance and accessibility, so their team can spend more time working with content editors through **direct outreach, education about WCAG standards, and demonstrating the impact on users with assistive technology.**

Inspired by the leadership of David Moretti and his team, we’re excited to play a supporting role as they build and shape their digital presence to be inclusive to all users and set a standard for other organizations to follow.

A human author creates the DubBlog posts. The AI tool Gemini is sometimes used to brainstorm subject ideas, generate blog post outlines, and rephrase certain portions of the content. Our marketing team carefully reviews all final drafts for accuracy and authenticity. The opinions and perspectives expressed remain the sole responsibility of the human author.
