Job hunting is stressful for everyone. But for people with disabilities, the process is often fraught with additional challenges that make it even more difficult to find a job. From inaccessible application portals to discriminatory job descriptions, navigating the job market as a disabled person often feels like an uphill battle. Here are some of the biggest headaches disabled job seekers face, including the dreaded decision of whether or not to disclose a disability, inaccessible technology, discriminatory requirements, and the unfortunate reality of being low-balled by opportunistic recruiters.

## The Disclosure Dilemma: To Tell or Not to Tell?

One of the first big questions every disabled job seeker faces is whether to disclose their disability to a potential employer. It’s a decision with lots of implications, and there’s no easy answer. While disclosing may allow you to request necessary accommodations during the interview process, it also opens the door to potential overt or unconscious discrimination.

Many disabled job seekers worry that disclosing their disability early in the process will lead to their application being tossed into the “no” pile, even if they're qualified for the position. Studies show that people with disabilities are often viewed as less capable, regardless of their actual skills and qualifications. In fact, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment-population ratio for people with disabilities is only 21.3%, compared to 65.4% for those without disabilities.

Some don’t have the option of hiding their disability because it is visible. Using a wheelchair, crutches, or a white cane is a neon sign that you have a disability. Some choose to wait until they’ve received a job offer before disclosing, while others feel it's better to disclose earlier, especially if they require accommodations for the interview process. The reality is that there is no perfect time to disclose. It’s a personal decision based on comfort level, the nature of the disability, and the anticipated response from the employer. Unfortunately, the fear of bias is real. Even though it's illegal to discriminate based on disability, many job seekers find themselves caught in the catch-22 of needing accommodations but fearing a rejection based on bias.

## Inaccessible Application Portals: The Digital Barrier

In this modern era, applying for a job should be as simple as logging onto a website and submitting a resume. However, for many disabled job seekers, especially those with visual or motor impairments, online job portals are a significant hurdle that must be overcome to express interest and receive consideration.

**Poorly Designed Forms**  
Many job application platforms are incompatible with screen readers, making it impossible for blind or visually impaired users to navigate the site. They might also not work with magnification designed for people with lesser levels of vision loss. Form fields might lack labels, buttons might not be keyboard-accessible, and complex CAPTCHA tests could block access entirely. Many, if not most, online job portals likely fall short of comprehensively following WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards. Even if the infrastructure of the online job portal is accessible, frequently the content is not, lacking contrast and alt-text for essential images.

**Inconsistent User Experiences**  
Even when an application portal claims to be accessible, that doesn’t always mean it works well across different browsers, assistive technologies, or devices. A platform might work perfectly fine on a desktop with a screen reader but becomes a tangled mess when accessed via a mobile device. It’s yet another barrier that disproportionately affects disabled people, forcing them to spend far more time and effort on tasks that should be simple.

## Job Descriptions That Discriminate: Code Words and Unattainable Standards

Another huge obstacle disabled job seekers face comes in the form of the job descriptions themselves. Employers often include requirements that, while seemingly neutral on the surface, can be discriminatory towards disabled applicants.

**_"Must Be Able to Lift 50 Pounds," hold a valid driver's license, and other bogus physical requirements_**  
This is one of the most common discriminatory requirements in job descriptions. Others include requirements for the ability to drive, sit, or stand for long periods of time. Unless the job is physically demanding, such as warehouse work, an office employee or a customer service representative often doesn't need to be able to lift heavy objects or drive. Sit/stand desks are a great and inexpensive accommodation that solves the issue of being unable to sit or stand for long periods.

Including discriminatory physical requirements in job descriptions deters applicants with mobility or strength impairments from applying. Even worse, it's often a blanket copy/paste requirement for positions that don’t need it. Even if there is an “accommodations available” statement in the fine print, people with disabilities know that at least the organization's Talent Acquisition and job description writing functions are less than inclusive.

**_"Fast-Paced Environment" and "Multi-Tasker"_**  
Another set of red flags for disabled applicants comes in the form of vague but harmful terms like “fast-paced environment” or “must be a multi-tasker.” These descriptions can make people with cognitive or sensory processing disabilities feel excluded. Phrases like this imply that the employer values speed over precision or favors workers who can juggle multiple tasks without additional support. Many disabled people can thrive in various roles but might need accommodations to perform at their best. By creating unnecessary barriers in the job description, employers can unintentionally (or intentionally) screen out disabled applicants.

**The Recruiter Trap: Getting Low-Balled**

Another frustration that disabled job seekers frequently encounter is getting lowballed by recruiters or employers who assume they can pay less simply because someone has a disability.

**_"You're Lucky to Get an Offer"_**  
Some opportunistic recruiters view disabled job seekers as a chance to offer a lower salary. They operate under the assumption that disabled people might be more desperate for work or believe that fewer opportunities are available to them. These recruiters take advantage of the situation by offering salaries far below the market rate. It’s a form of exploitation, and while it’s often subtle, it contributes to the wage gap between disabled and non-disabled employees. In fact, according to a 2020 study, workers with disabilities earn approximately 37% less than their non-disabled counterparts.

Recently, I was told that the top end of the pay range for a job in Silicon Valley requiring multiple college degrees and 5-10 years of experience was less than I could make as a manager at the In ‘n Out Burger down the street from where the job was located. Another contract role with no benefits in the same vicinity had an hourly rate even lower than that pathetic salary. That is unacceptable. If you want to hire people in expensive areas to do in-person work, you have to bite the bullet and pay wages that are not considered poverty-level in that area.

**_Lack of Negotiation_**  
Negotiating salaries can be difficult for any job seeker, but disabled applicants may feel they have less leverage. After all, if they’ve had to disclose their disability or request accommodations during the hiring process, they may fear being seen as "troublesome" if they push for a higher salary. Employers, aware of this dynamic, might offer lower pay, hoping the applicant won’t negotiate. This places disabled job seekers in a precarious position where they must choose between accepting lower pay or risking the opportunity altogether. Imposter syndrome is also a big factor in negotiations where people with disabilities feel like they are worth less than their non-disabled counterparts.

## Conclusion: We Deserve Better

Job hunting is already a nerve-wracking experience for anyone, but for disabled people, the process is littered with extra hurdles that make it even harder to secure meaningful employment. Whether it’s the anxiety over disclosing a disability, dealing with inaccessible application systems, decoding discriminatory job descriptions, or battling lowball salary offers, disabled job seekers face far more than their fair share of challenges.  
  
Employers need to do better. Job portals should be accessible, job descriptions should be inclusive, and disabled applicants deserve fair pay without being taken advantage of. To build truly inclusive workplaces, we need to remove these barriers. And it starts with treating disabled job seekers with the respect, dignity, and equity they deserve. That starts with not treating accommodations requests like they are special or a hassle, not asking illegal questions, and removing ableist bias from job descriptions.
